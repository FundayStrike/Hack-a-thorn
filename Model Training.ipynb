            " I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer . Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge . My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep . You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again . Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars . Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it . Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good. Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time. The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night . Nothing all great . 6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260 . The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast . The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him . Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse. We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment . We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely . Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit . Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery . Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing . Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner . Nothing . The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv . Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all . Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you . We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom . There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical . Little bit on the pricey side. Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective . Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums . Please see above. The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two . Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality . not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation. The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more . the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that. Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet . Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy . Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate . Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again . Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that . The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning . Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either . The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups . Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here. The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam . When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all . I loved everything . when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction. there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night . Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task . The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference . The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management . The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor . Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again . Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room . The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe . Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation . Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip . Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived . The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass . Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone . The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price . Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra . The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive . upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside . If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast . The hotel is undergoing massive construction with workers all around and this was not indicated at the time of booking We had a rodent in the room one night due to the disturbance of construction . Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors . The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money . I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy . The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel . Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful . The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy . Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss. That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel . Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait . No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up . We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain . Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done . The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere . In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair . So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms. There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas . The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate . Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout . Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend . split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing . Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud. Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought. There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant . it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot . Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle . Construction during the day though not intrusive. The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined . No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance. There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place . The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious . there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view. Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant . We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel . I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 . The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done . the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware . The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough . Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend . The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level . The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small . Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed. The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central. Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression . We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick . We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back . The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim . We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on . Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space. There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night . It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished . First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all . Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms . the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor . The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well . There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work . Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower . We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow . The fact I had to leave. The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished . The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating . Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive . Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road . We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel . The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper . The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning . There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major . More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on . When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste . Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost . Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night . The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night . Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly . The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid . I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel. the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise . Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained . The hotel looked abit tired lots of scratches and market on the walls the floors in the room looked a little dirty and our room smelt very bad of dirty drains so bad we actually moved rooms. The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking. Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem . Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired . Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through . The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive . The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money . Nothing One Of The Receptionist she did a racist comment regarding My accent and my country The housekeeping Didnt like was a disaster Enter in The room Without knock The door a tall girl . Breakfast was crazy expensive Location required about a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway Construction is underway for a massive expansion project so there was some noise during the day . The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu . Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent . the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking. The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards . We didn t have a bad experience . Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue. Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it . They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back. When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts . Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting . The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom . The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp . The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion . Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool. The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel . The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult . the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again . In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena. Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only . Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful . Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel. No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine . the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants . The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel . Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing . Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please . Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive . Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you . The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times . At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked . Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc . The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future . Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had . next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay. Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am . The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs . The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift . Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all . No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping. The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice . We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice . Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done. Theres nothing we was unhappy with. The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it . Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets . n a. It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre . No bad experiences. floor tiles in bath room shower were slippery when wet Black coating on glass wall between bath bed room was obviously an attempt to darken the glass tint that was inadequate Hall way to rooms on 2nd floor was too dark gloomy Reception area stuffy too hot on day we checked in I question the 4 star rating. The bathroom needed to be deep cleaned Tiles had water marks no toiletries just champu and shower caps Loads of marks around the room of heavy use needs updating. There was a problem with the hairdryer in our room The hotel sent a replacement but it couldn t be used in front of a mirror Just a minor detail really but a bit annoying . There were renovations going on that made it quite noisy at times. The variety of the breakfast was not as good Empty marmalade coffee was more water . Small room in 2 levels connected by a very narrow and small steps The room in general shows a lack of maintenance walls courtains etc Very noisy room there where machines working just a few meters far from the window . Our room was above the bar area because the air conditioning was not working we had to have the windows wide open because it was hot so it was quite noisy late at night . Rooms were not sufficiently cleaned on a daily basis i e no fresh cups provided once used toilet rolls not replaced bit embarrassing having to ask at reception for more . The only thing our room lacked was decent storage space but for a shorter stay 3 days this wasn t an issue . A bit noisy You can hear a lot through the walls It s a shame the construction is still going on however there is minimal disruption from this and it sounds like it will be great when done . service of the breakfast team plates were not taken away had more eye to themselves entrance looked poor given the renovation of the other parts of the building . Beds sucked Air conditioner too loud for use . The beds were a little small and very low . House keeping making up rooms and replacing toiletries was very sporadic . Slow check in Slow service in bar Transparent bathroom door. Minimal space around the bed. Room rather small but on two levels. Quite pricey considering breakfast was extra.

Expensive to get to from the train station airport. Doors to the bathroom. Really nothing negative to say about this hotel. No coffee or tea in the room or lobby No one to help with our bags from Tax into the Hotel No handicapped access At 80 years old it was very difficult for me to lug two large suit cases up the 12 oursidestairs and then up into the lobby . Room was pretty small for the three of us . Nothing really . Only cab service to airport is expensive compared to others 48 pounds plus tip . London hotel rooms are very small There was very little storage Would have liked to have some drawers however small for storage . The room for three people was on the small side . Room wasn t ready on arrival after travelling from Leeds to London and phoning 2hours away to reserve parking Rude receptionist to girlfriend about parking as it wasn t our fault someone had taken our space We arrived at 16 00 and our room wasn t ready so was given a complimentary drink each and half an hour later still wasn t ready and being told it would be a further 40minutes Just wasn t good enough as we were only staying for 1 night and had a concert to go to . Our room allocated wasn t up to our expectations bathroom was to small when you opened bathroom door you banged into the toilet We had to require a different room at an extra cost of 30 a night . The cooked elements of breakfast could have been better but the continental selection was very good . The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv . Lower ground floor room L01 possibly the smallest bathroom I ve ever stayed in awful View from Windows not inspiring to see the rat traps outside Won t go back . Dimensions of the room small But I m was a single room and Erls court London The space cost money as a traditional London hotel. Squeaky floors Difficult to go to the bathroom at night without waking my husband Also 4th floor our window didn t open to the outside . Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves . The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company . The front desk staff was not very informed regarding city happenings or tips Fortunately I could rely on the internet to answer more specific questions Additionally I was not entirely confident that they understood the questions I was asking in English . Staff not very friendly Did their job but seldom smiled or made one feel welcomed . Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there . The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold . The shower temperature was changing all the time from freezing to boiling and back . choice of food in bar wasn t too good but there are lots of great places to eat nearby so there was no problem . The fact the windows don t open and the room was hot and stuffy and the bed was hard it was necessary to switch heating off put aircon on maximum and then of course it was noisy and even so there was no fresh air which is essential. The rooms are very small we had trouble fitting 2 suitcases in The price is fairly high even by London s standards and breakfast was extra . The room is a little small and the decor is dated . Air con seemed to be set on winter warmer but easily resolved switched it off and opened window simples . We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food . breakfast the same everyday not much options but good and clean fitness center has one machine and they call fitness center small rooms . Breakfast was crowded at times and the selection of food was ok but not great . Rooms could be updated that being said everything is functional and very clean . Bed was too soft bathroom a wee bit small for manoeuvring in . The wifi is only 500kb s which isn t fast by today s standards The power socket near the bed was loosen I can t charge my phone . We were put in a basement room which certainly wouldn t have classed as a 4 star room How ever it was clean and bed was comfortable . Wifi is ridiculously slow and fiddly to connect using Chrome Breakfast coffee was only average. We choose to personally take our laundry to be cleaned as it was 1 10 th of the cost of what the hotel was going to charge this was very excessive The room was very warm but we managed by keeping the windows and drapes open . Not convinced that solo travellers are treated with the same consideration as others for room location in the hotel in particular. Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive . The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back. couldn t work out how to crank DOWN the heating in the room Bathroom is miniscule Mini bar was very limited with its choice. Breakfast is expensive especially when I have already paid over 90 for a standard room per night . mistake over payments and noise due to creaky floorbords Also It would ve been nice if we were told beforehand that a 60 euros deposit would be required regarding potential mini bar consumptions When we refused to comply the person in charge told us curtly that our mini bar shall be emptied fothwith . The only thing I can think of is that i would have preferred not to have a wall to wall carpet in the room but it seemed clean so it was no big deal . I had to ask at breakfast all 3 mornings we were there for coffee and re fills I think it would be better to have coffee on the buffet as you could just help yourself like you could with tea. My one complaint is the overly soft mattresses It was not good for my back . The mattress wasn t comfortable and the pillows were way too soft I had a neck ache the next morning The room was super tiny We stayed at the Hilton Bankside and the room was so spacious in comparison . Temperature in the room was difficult to regulate . I don t know if it was because I booked through Booking com but seemed to get the worst room in the place Underground with no view Unable to book breakfast for second day at the reduced price as I should have done it on check in I didn t know what I was going to be doing on check in Tea and biscuits not replenished the second day . Really nothing this was a perfect choice . Rooms are not heated may be an issue in very cold winters Gym is open from 4 00 pm to 10 00pm when you usually are out . Soiled chair in room Pillows not clean Shower temp control very sensitive in 1st room we stayed in Value for money. We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so . No Iron and ironing board and maybe a few sachets of hot chocolate in the room nothing really to complain about . Did book a twin bedded room and got a very large double so it didn t matter too much Loo very low lucky I am only 5ft 2 . Staff not particularly helpful Have stayrf before and not had room serviced so had to request this 3 times Breakfasy ok but not outstanding for a 4 Rooms small esp bathroom and not particularly warm. Housekeeping missed my room one day and although I did not make much of a fuss over it I did not get a convincing explanation I did get an apology though . room wasn t ready was upgraded but had to pay for a drink while we waited. bathroom is really small. Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset . Weird atmosphere in reception many eastern European staff Room Cold and uninspiring 4 per drink of cheap orange juice mixed with tap water Overpriced overall. Front desk night manager charged my bill in dollars without permission He tried to net an extra 40 on my bill with the horrible exchange rate When I caught it he told me I must have authorized it at check in which I had not Completely unacceptable . The towel in the bathroom had blood on it and it wasn t our blood so disgusting Also we had a room below the pavement at the front of the hotel with a lot of noise from foot traffic and their conversations . The gym facility is pointless make sure you go elsewhere if you want to use the gym . Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of . Saw into the cleaner maids cupboard due to a door not fully shut during hours when servicing of rooms was not happening. The air condition did not work for cooling down the room we were told to shut it off and open the windows which brought all sounds from streets in from police etc Our room on the 5th floor was small and the bathroom was very small about 3 m2 . The bathroom is too small and the break fast lacks variety for one staying more than four days I stayed for 6 nights The cleaners don t replenish toiletry supplies facial tissues ran out from my rom and they didn t refinish them They also don t replace bed covers if you don t ask them. It was noisy throughout the night because of the central heating boiler being so close to room 116 If it wasn t the boiler it was something else noisy . The heating was not working in the room for the first two days. I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer. Noise from other rooms eg talking late at night airless corridors smelled a bit institutional. The room facing the street sometimes there s some noise from people chat but it became silence after midnight . I can t think of a thing that needed improved upon All aspects of my stay were excellent . Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars . Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient . Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it . Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help . There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows . We only stayed 2 nights . There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK . there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12 . The room was really really cold The heating didn t work I was brought an electric heater but the room was too cold for it to make any difference This led to a really bad nights sleep . Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close . The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm. Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place . Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint . Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin . Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors . Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky . It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again. The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same . Why carp when there is nothing to carp about . The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did . The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control. The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress . The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better . Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night . Bed sheets pillows and carpet could be cleaner bugs . Nothing really A lower price is always good of course . WiFi was a bit slow . Housekeeping staff were rude shower had water pressure and temperature problems and the hotel has double charged me and has yet to solve the issue . Ex Suite was extremely small smaller then our yacht cabin the week before The temperature of the room could not be lower than 18 degrees which wasn t cool enough . The bathroom is on the smaller side . the room was a little small and the shower ran hot and cold . Room was small but adequate There was old toothpaste under a rim of the washbasin which was never reached by the cleaner even though I put some paper on it to indicate its existence Fire alarm went off at 2 am and we were all in the street for a while All was eventually sorted but no general instructions or explanation . Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident . The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did . Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either . Nothing really . Our room had a very pungent smell of tobacco smoke The blackout blind didn t work very well . Nothing. Air conditioning a little noisy we opened the window instead. They weren t inexpensive . Farthest room from elevator Uncomfortable bed Air conditioning would not set to our temperature therefore far too hot in room Staff were not interested when told about it We did not sleep well because of it . Room needed to be redecorated as it was a little worn looking. Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal . Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel. Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink . Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options . Wifi is so weak and slow at night heating is weak although it is coming from a controllable central air conditioning bath is a bit small hotel overall is a bit dated breakfast is expensive. Not keen on the steps up to the front door is there an alternative entrance for mobility impaired . Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way . Took several days to fix a broken window curtain so woken very early in the morning by sunlight Temperature fluctuations in the shower from scalding hot to cold was annoying . Not much room in bathroom and room was basic for the price paid Aside from that the hotel was lovely . Its a hit and miss with the reception staff Sometimes I got lucky with someone who s friendly and provided excellent customer service but sometimes some of them were too green and not that trained The restaurant got very busy during breakfast time so the staff could get unfriendly . The double room we stopped in was a little small but was adequate . Occasional quirky sound from the floor next door or 1 floor above quite disturbing Expensive . the size of the room is small for Americans but pretty standard for Europe . Let me think about it Nothing really . The restaurant changed as we were about to leave and the new menu didn t look very appealing. I can t think of a single thing . Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip . The toilet was too low to the floor The room was much too hot and the Windows did not open . There was nothing in the mini fridge It was empty I would have liked to have had the option of drinking eating something later in the evening before going to bed without having to call room service . The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count . The rooms were extremely small I don t think the breakfast was good value for money. The room was too hot needed a fan over night to cool down no opening windows. Wifi is hit and miss not a huge deal but it isn t great . Room very warm aircon was not cooling down the room Bathroom very small and toilet very low . No water to drink in spa area Room on small side compared to advertised twin room Kettle plug dangling not obvious where to plug in . Breakfast used to include a better selection ie smoked salmon more fruit selection champagne Now more English breakfast which means the cost is pricey at 15 pounds Wait staff not very friendly had to ask for coffee after they passed my table several times . The bathrooms are tiny but do work in as much as the showers are good but unless your very small it s impossible to dry oneself other than in the bedroom There is a lack Of plug sockets in the bedrooms and the bar area is soulless . No negatives . Rooms are small and would have preferred one overlooking the garden instead we were over the front door and the flag pole was noisy . My room on the fourth floor had only narrow windows at the top of the wall and those were partly blocked by the roof decorations so the room had a boxy closed in feeling . the bathrooms ar very small BUT everything you need is there They were also spotless. Serving of coffee for breakfast had logistics problems Please give people a tip that they can ask for a pot to be filled with coffee to be able to serve themselves at acceptable frequencies Now for every cup we were dependent on staff not always available and not always 100 coffee focussed noticing our lack of java and distributing one cup at a time . Nothing. Nothing . Above Good location. Bathroom a bit small. Room a bit too small a bit too warm with no way to lower the heat the closet smells so i wasn t that happy to put my clothes in there . Breakfast was disappointing eggs were dry inside not cooked to order no hot dish for vegetarians. things have changed slightly under new management no sparkling wine at breakfast cheese selection reduced no more nesepresso small changes but these were nice touches that are now lacking. Breakfast was a little disorganised staff a little inattentive Decent selection however of food . Parking was handy and safe but quite expensive . The bathroom was tiny and the pillows a bit lumpy but nothing terrible . Shower head a little unpredictable in terms of direction. Nothing could have been better It was perfect . Cooked breakfast not very imaginative Too small plates Can t cook eggs Room not as big as I hoped for in exec room king size bed. The room is too warm cooling is not in use duting the heating season The hotel still uses its famous breakfast in marketing That is almost a fraud The breakfast is not nearly what it used to be It was okay but not a reason to come any more The location still is a reason . Room was too hot the windows do open but there were noisy revellers so we had to close the windows . Nothing at all. the sofa in the room was quite uncomfortable leaving me with a aching back . The bathroom is quite small but did have a tub. Wifi does not work in the room its a shame for a big business city like london in 2016 to dont provide proper wifi Had to work from the toilet where the signal was here. The only bad thing I can tell about teh hotel is that the room was just a little bit small Not much space to move . Room was cold the warm air heating struggled to keep up with a very cold spell in London and the thermostat controls are impossible to understand The hotel clearly has problems getting cleaning staff to work on Saturday Our room was not ready on time Having said that the staff were quick to find an alternative room albeit a cold one . Double glazing windows would have kept cold and noise outside But then this is a London old hotel . Insufficient UK power points for a couple on business without requesting UK adaptors Breakfast reasonable choice but a number of items were cool instead of hot Gym could do with an update Room was a little too compact . Dated rooms rooms stated bath and shower but did not have both a dated hotel on rooms but bar was trendy setting Reception staff do not care when you have booked as you are captive there . Very definitely the breakfast Fruit selection limited Very little input from staff Many 4 star hotels will bring coffee or tea to your table The fried eggs were dry and inedible They clearly had been there too long and had not been replenished The outlook on to the garden was lovely . The room for 3 person are not very big And another very bad surprise is with Booking Hotel i Made a reservation with a breakfast but when i arrived at hotel the breakfast didn t inclused. Bathrrom quite cramped breakfast was ok but not outstanding more fruit . My only thing I would say was the food during the evening and this is only because the choices were very limited I am a fussy eater and couldn t see anything I liked however the breakfast was lovely. The sauna facilities were located in the same room as the massage tables and exercise bikes a little compact and restrictive with no changing facilities . nothing. Thin wall can hear everything on the hallway I would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by . Worst nights sleep in a long long time Pillows were awful gave me a bad neck Couldn t turn the heating off I barely slept due to how hot it was Bathroom was absolutely stifling . First night s stay was very hot because air conditioning had been turned off throughout the hotel Requested a fan for our room but did not receive one . Front of room breakfast staff woman was very rude to us The scrambled eggs did not taste good at all Very buttery and watery . Nothing could have been better This is one of if not the best hotels I ve stayed in for it s attention to detail . A little cold in the room and what seemed an older heating system needed to be switched on to warm the room up not as welcoming to the room when it feels cold as you go in . Rooms to small smell coming from shower drain sugar not replenish after first night constant noise from other ac units by the time you got hot breakfast it was cold. Room was too hot even with air con on full and heating right down . Bed in room 110 was appalling and needs replacement To compound this the staff were aware of the problem which means I was not the first to complain . old building re furnished sound travelled from top floor down bathroom very small. very thin walls terrible nights sleep doors banging and water running no help with luggage offered dining room for breakfast far too warm for comfort reception staff in morning not offered to get taxi until i asked specifically to order write up on booking com implied 350 yards to Olympia it was not. Bed is too hard pillows were horrible AC didn t work well and was extremely hot even though it was at its maximum and slow wifi Wouldn t recommend it at all. The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly . breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme . New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long. Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future . nothing. Unfortunately there was a constant tapping noise in the room coming from within the bathroom The hairdryer did not work and only found out the morning I was checking out and didn t have time to do anything about it . Lower ground floor room basement basically next to offices and directly opposite service lift which meant a lot of passing noise Window was a view of a stairway fire escape so lacked privacy with curtains open . The hotel is nice but the facilities are poor the bed felt like IKEA The gym was a joke the hotel bar didn t know how to make simple cocktails. The room was too hot despite the fact we turned down the thermostat . Rooms could have been a bit bigger Design and decor dated . nothing. Nothing really important. Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable . a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light . This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy . The room was small and very warm even with air conditioning It was situated beside the lift even though I requested a quiet room The bathroom was even smaller . Room a little on the small side though perfect for one person Food in room service could have been a little more interesting Good coffee though . room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast . Small rooms . English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice . The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January . Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels . I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home . Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better. Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again . The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price . Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger . See above tangent . I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again . We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor . Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers. in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources. It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride . 1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm . On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show . The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny . Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good . Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained . Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess. Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall . Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London . The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant . One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful . We had no ventilation in bathroom. The beds Quite small room We asked if there were complimentary coffee somewhere but were not informed that we had it in the room It was hidden in the cupboard . Nothing . we had a bit of a hiccup the room we were given first as we opened the door the smell of smoke was very bad they moved us to a other room which was lovely. Small rooms but very tidy Room insolation not perfect we could hear people from the room next to ours . Room and bathroom were far too hot even with both bedroom windows open it was too hot. Nothing It s perfect . The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor . It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so. No bad experiences at all. Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money . Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent .

Not a fan of the breakfast to be honest the eggs were quite watery Also we did not buy breakfast in advance which was good because when you arrive they give you a 25 off voucher I would have been very annoyed if I had paid full price in advance and the person next to me got a better deal . No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food . We have been charged for room service that we did not have I spoke to the hotel yesterday who said they would remove the charge of 43 53 issue and amended invoice and email to confirm that the charge had been removed This has not been done . It would be helpful if the hotel could provide more detailed info on how to get to the hotel from the subway station Customers shld look out for the green elephant in the doorway otherwise really difficult to find the entrance to the hotel . Every thing was excellent Apart from room service for food that never came and been woken up at 9 am by staff walking in room When I mentioned in to reception when checking out they didn t seam bothered . No problems at all . Not a lot to put in this section If I was going to be very picky I d say the food menu was average but still very palatable i e not bad Wine list could be improved . Meals very plain No extras or garnishes Restaurant staff didn t seem very knowledgeable Cold croissants for breakfast . No toothbrush provided. Nothing. The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while . The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi . The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows . They don t have parking and there is no easy parking available nearby . The staff is quite annoying and could be more discreet entering the room without invitation The view from the hotel was quite uninspiring . Breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary A la carte was also possible but we didn t try . More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets . The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft . This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time . Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building. Some of the complimentary items of food from the room were missing and there was an empty box in the minibar too . A few more little milks maybe as I drink a lot of tea but I was given a little jug of milk when I asked . The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels . Nothing your doing a fantastic job. The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better . If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything . Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction . At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel . We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay . The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view . Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them . Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector . Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street . Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed . My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison . Everything was genuinely perfect . Nothing Our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our Green Band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors. Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code . It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room . its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet. The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this . Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast . A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans . Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side . Lowered check in desk for shorter or disabled Jellybeans and Pringles missing Only one duck 2people Automatic doors for people with mobility issues and wheelchair users Didn t get the room I booked . The ends of the bath were very vertical it looked pretty but not the most comfortable for a relaxing soak after a long day but I am aware I m fussy with my baths . A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room . Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay . We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted . 1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced . Can t think of anything that could have been improved . The fire alarm went off in the middle of the night which was a bit disorientating Pretty sure this isn t regular but there you go . Sorry can t think of any negative thing . How hasn t this place got a extra star It should be five star not four . Really we could find fault with nothing . The basin doesn t seem to be clean enough It s difficult to drain waters down the basin. The shower was half clean the window curtain and the window were dirty . Could have had a few more different tea bags in room . As always the price of breakfast is far too expensive There are several places nearby to eat at sensible prices . We heard our neighbors bathroom in the night. Just loved it . IN the early morning my sleep was interrupted by the buzzer from the speaker on the desk I didn t know what happened The air conditioning didn t keep in a right temperature . Hard to find the taxi entrance so getting the bags down the stairs is a bit tricky but the staff are happy to help . All is not good breakfast expensive bed horrible and water is not hot for shower Likewise bedroom was not clean . We didn t take the overpriced breakfast instead we went to a cafe a few steps away . The rooms and corridors were much to hot however I was able to lower the temperature in the room There is absolutely nothing else to complain about A lovely hotel. There wasn t a full length mirror in the room We were going to an event and could have done with it in addition a magnifying mirror to put on eye makeup . Unfortunately the safe wouldn t unlock they tried drilling it for 1 2 hour couldn t stand anymore told them to take it away which they did and returned me the contents but had no other safe available I did get a breakfast for my daughter husband and me free . Wardrobe was not so big but ours room had a nice sofa zone that we use to leave stuff so in the end was all ok. I realise that good accommodation is expensive in central London but neverthelessI feel this hotel is somewhat costly We were on a room only rate so I cannot comment on the breakfasts or dinners but breakfasts are readily available within a short stroll of the hotel . Just a little pricey would have liked to spend an extra day Maybe need to book very early to get a good deal . We didn t have a very good experience in the restaurant because of a problem in the kitchen half of the set menu was unavailable and no alternative was offered Service was very slow one hour and a Half for 1 burger 1 risotto and 2 pies . I can t think of anything that could have been improved . All minor issues The location of the room was good however I did expect to have both a shower and a bath in the room When we checked in we had a choice of either bath or shower not both which wasn t a massive deal There was also a note to say what was complimentary however there were a few of the items missing Also in the morning three times our door was knocked for the room to be cleaned well before check out time One opened the door to come into our room while we were still in bed sleeping . The food we ordered in the hotel restaurant wasn t available We had to venture out to eat instead . Several options on evening menu not available even ran out of chips . The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else . really couldn t fault it . We brought friends to dinner and discovered very limited choice on the menu although we were compensated . Room smelt a little smokey and the towels didn t smell fresh slightly musty My in room breakfast pancakes went so hard I couldn t cut them which makes me think they were zapped to make them hot . Was not told about the 30 extra per night they charged you get it back at the end of your stay but does not go back into your bank for a few days This needs to be brought to people s attention before they arrive . While some staff were outstanding and performed very well e g Jesus Other staff were just rude to the level that I will not recommend this hotel to any of my network . We chose to decline the breakfast as it was overpriced and London has so much more to offer when it comes to food Pillows were too chunky. All good . I didn t understand the continental breakfast setup My room didn t include breakfast A weetabix and pastry and tea ended up costing 18 pounds . No full length mirror in bedrooms Breafast quality could have been better servuce was lacking. Being really really picky here more space on desk to lay out cosmetics to sit and do make up in comfort rather than using bathroom mirror . Room was too hot even with air con as could only put down to 19 degrees . I bought drinks at the bar not waiter service and they still tried to add the 8 service charge They were not happy when I queried it and asked for the money back Light lunch snacks were very average and overpriced. Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them . In an ideal world the hotel would be a bit closer to the tube station although it was only a 10 minute walk away . We were put in a disabled room so no bath . Check in lady was quite abrupt and that s the first impression spoiled instantly Double room was booked via this site and but got told on arrival not advised that there are no double beds available and I will have to have room with two singles Disappointment number two and hope for comfy sleep gone AC unit in the room was making very loud clicking noise faulty stat occasionally Bose docking station only suitable for iPhone 4 do those still exist There was a sign about the bath mat in the bathroom but no bath mat At this price range it was somewhat disappointing experience . My room was opposite the lifts and was quite noisy which wasn t ideal when trying to work Would have been good if there was a sliding door in between the entry area and bedroom so it could be closed to minimise outside sounds . the heating was turned to 25 degrees in the room when we checked in so it was a bit warm . there was no bubble bath. Room facing a wall . I was disappointed that there no sofa or armchir in the room as depicts in the room description The view offices 5 meter from my window The price of room service. Need to put more milk and tea bags in the room but I find that problem during most of my stays in hotels The room was clean but there was a couple of hairs in the bath probably from the cleaner I DIDN T make a fuss and just washed them away you could tell the room was spotless everywhere else and it was just a mistake the bath had been cleaned . Nothing . Was difficult to see from afar where hotel is Had to literally be up close to realise yoi were at the right place . In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault . room isn t as photo shows in booking We booked superior king room with balcony descprtion photo shows room size 30m2 with sofa We were given a room on 4 floor the room was small abt 20 23m2 only one bed with little standing space beside bed no sofa balcony not like photo shown Where u can have dinner there this balcony only had standing space . One staff member on reception was a bit trite when queried why photo ID was required for a second time after checking in earlier in the day . The AC couldn t keep the room cool during the day even with the shades down About 1 3 of the TV channels didn t work due to weak signal Only one elevator bank for guests it s a walk from the higher number rooms There are other lifts but they re staff only . Nothing. There really wasn t anything to dislike about this hotel . Regular customer of Apex City of London hotel They didn t know I was a returning customer upon arrival Breakfast should have been included for over 300 for a room . The room that I was given is smaller than what was shown when I reserved online and they immediately ask you to upgrade and pay more to get the bigger one The room view was to corporate offices so I couldn t open the windows no privacy inside the room because and because of that it was always lights on mode . The room was warm overnight despite the aircon being set to the lowest possible temperature . The restaurant was not big enough to cope with demand so we had to wait for a table to become free. Staff wasn t super friendly Doorman was impatient and bordering on rude . No decaff tea bags and only one packet of biscuits in the room . Seemed very matter of fact at Reception Lacked warmth Didn t like smokers on balcony next to mine . Location was ok but a lot of places were shut at weekend so there wasn t too much right on the doorstep . Oddly I was placed in a disabled room but not a problem and nice to see that they have great facilities for those who may be less mobile . Nothing. Nothing . It was an excellent hotel all round Nothing to complain about . We had an evening meal and the menu hadn t changed since our last visit . The noise and souproof in general specially from the inside the entrance door too close from the bed. Breakfast was chaotic Slow and had to keep on asking for missing items Definitely the B team on that day Was better in previous stay . The really long and winding corridor leading to my room being a single person it was a bit spooky walking to the room late in the evening . Booked a room for 3 and were told it would be a sofa bed Didn t expect to be as comfy as a bed but also didn t expect it to be excruciatingly uncomfortable No sleep in preparation for a long drive home Also didn t notice we had no bedding for the sofa bed until we were all ready for bed at quite a late hour and then had to wait for it to be brought up A bit disappointing after a long day . Enjoyed it all . Only 1 small bottle of water left per day and our room never had the complimentary snacks Pringles and jelly beans during our 4 night stay . When we booked the photos saw a couch in the room our room didn t have one Actually this was not a problem I prefer to have more empty space Also there are no smoking rooms in this hotel and while this might be great for most visitors since I am travelling very often to London it will be a problem for me during winter months . None. Staff in reception not helpful nore friendly Besides we had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink at the bar the waiter never came we had to go to the bar Poor service compared to the hotel ranking. Nothing to improve wish I could ve stayed longer . We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading . Nothing. The coffee was a bit weak but this is a small shortcoming in context . Staff were rude and not very pleasant to deal with at reception I also called in house service for a cup as we were only given one in our room I spoke to a very rude man who told me to call housekeeping but didn t give me an extension number Once I called reception they said they would called in house service but I still didn t receive the cup Perhaps this individual member of staff mentioned above begrudgingly didn t feel it was his duty P Also used the public computers at the reception but the printers didn t work Not much point of them being there in my view or perhaps just do some maintenance In summary great stay and I would stay again but a reminder to hotel that a smile goes a long way . area very quiet on weekends some shops closed as financial area but still only 10 15 mins walk to convent garden only issue with the room was that it was a few minutes walk from reception get a room on the side above the reception . Located in the business district thus a fair distance walk from most attractions and restaurants Limited view. Can t think of anything we were so pleased with everything. Very poor front desk service the morning we left We did not receive the wake up call we ordered and were very late leaving for the airport I attempted to get help from front desk staff who were very uninformed about transportation options to Heathrow a very basic piece of knowledge for hotel staff in London We ended up with a taxi that took 1 5 hours due to a bike race nobody at the hotel seemed aware of this either and cost about 125 If you re not from London be aware that this hotel is in more of a business district Many of the surrounding restaurants and shops were closed on Saturday We walked to Covent Garden for pretty much everything . Can t find fault with anything loved it . Room was not ready for us to check in The front desk staff who dealt with us were cold and impersonal No sense of personal individualised service . Access to the bar was difficult as there were some corporate events Understandable considering the quality of the hotel so not really a low point just a minor inconvenience. Accessibility is terrible in the hotel we have a baby buggy and it was nightmare for us to enter and exit from hotel no ramps lots of steps hotel is very big and room corridors are like a maze there is only one lift the other one next to it is broken and not fixed in 6 days on the hotel you have go long way on maze like corridors front desk was also very rude on check in I had a problem with my credit card and the staff was not helpful and acted very rude. Housekeeping didn t wash used cups didn t change duvet cover was clean on arrival dropped spoon and made a coffee stain . Milk had gone off in room facility plus only one packet of biscuits between us Staff seemed unable to activate second keycard for room and only one pair of complementary slippers instead of two Not enough vegetarian options on the restaurant menu . As above. Two adjacent rooms were requested Upon arrival only one was ready . Room looked over by office block Strong smell of cleaning fluid in the room Staff gave us another room without hesitation. Location for me but it is still very central . A bit mean with tea coffee milk etc The only outside seating area was very busy we couldn t get a table in the evening . Nothing. Bar and food prices but then it is London and the whole City is a rip off . It would be nice if the waiter who brings the breakfast to the room was as friendly as all the other staff . The lighting was pretty dark Room lighting would go a long way instead of a lamp . Entering the hotel involved crossing an open courtyard and negotiating a number of steps As it was raining when we arrived we got wet and it was uncomfortable having to carry suitcases up and down steps . They gave me the barrier free room which was not as comfortable as expected View on a wracked street corner so I felt a bit disappointed in view of the rather high price . Details of the restaurant menus in the room might have encouraged us to use these as it was we ate out . Nothing could be better everything was excellent. Skimpy with the tea biscuits coffee tray No opening window Bit pricey compared with other similar London stays . Nothing at all. We had to change rooms which was easily done and quickly without a hassle because the air conditioning was not working . Nothing to complain about here . Cannot think of anything. My self and my wife came to london for a weekend birthday celebration On arrival one of your staff members rudely asked us for our passports just because we look asian we were both born in the uk and explained this She then carried on asking us for our passports even after we told her we have british passports She then asked how long we have been in the country Very very rude discriminatory spoilt our weekend We have used holiday inn many times before but will never use it again we feel very strongly about this will be submitting a formal complaint online review REGARDS MR SURJ DHAMI . The place is designed by someone who thinks design is more important than comfort By the end of the trip I found the walk along the very long corridor to my room was almost painful The room was ridiculously dark It was a big room but with one small window For that reason alone I would never stay there again The air conditioning could not be turned low enough to make a difference Almost every night I was woken up because it was too hot to sleep even on top of the bed The staff did not say hello to me once and I was there for five nights The cost was extortionate given the pleasantness of the facility But it was then suggested to me that I had taken things out of the minibar which was untrue Not to be repeated . Kippers they forgot our order and when they came they were very small and dry Try Loch Fyne kippers Best not to have kippers on the menu if they are not up to standard . Only tiny issue the internet was slow and the firewall prevented me from remote access to my server which was based in London not that far away so that was a major inconvenience as on my last day I had to work . Bar prices but that s London for you . Can t really think of anything. For 3 days straight I found the staff dumped my cloths on the floor luckily with the cloth clean bag The room cleaning did not reach the standard level of services . Laundry dry cleaning rates Whilst service and product is excellent the cost seems much too high . Nothing. The breakfast and drinks at the bar were quite expensive we went to a place around the corner and got breakfast for 2 people for under the cost of 1 person at the hotel. Too little wardrobe space No chest of drawers in the room only two very small drawers Lighting in the bathroom could have been better No where to put toiletries in the shower. Absolutely nothing. Expensive breakfast stairs in front of the hotel made it very inconvenient to disabled people and guests with heavier luggage. Did not have enough time to appreciate all of the hotel facilities . No FOX news or CNBC on TV these are important channels for US visitors Big selection of international channels from other countries Wish there was ice machine on floor for convenience. There was a bit of a wait for some at breakfast This is being super picky though as genuinely hard to find any fault at all . The breakfast was expensive but we wanted to explore and so brunched out while we were there . We asked for an invoice of the stay on departure and was told it would be emailed to us days later still nothing so I called the hotel and asked again they repeated my email to me and said it would be done right away 2 weeks later still nothing at all I think they ve over charged me for something and with them not wanting to get caught out that s why their withholding the details of my bill . I sleep warm and I couldn t get the room cool enough but that s minor . All good . There wasn t anything we didn t like . I stayed on a Sunday night and paid a very good rate for this quality of hotel but expensive during the week . I couldn t fault it at all. There was nothing to fault . The ONLY down point I have on the hotel is the heat in the room at times was very very high I understand the weekend we visited London was very warm but the air con could be reviewed to allow lower temperatures . I found the breakfast a bit too expensive but the service was great . Limited views but not an issue for us as it s not located for that and we were out most of the day and evening . Nothing everything was spot on . Breakfast was very expensive. Am struggling to think of any negatives In fact I cannot think of any at all . Bar prices a little steep . Breakfast prices might be reduced. When staying in a deluxe room guests have use of the Club Lounge except in our case due to the free upgrade I thought this was a bit mean spirited Also we were awoken at 8 20am on our last morning by maintenance but reception staff were unsure why however they offered us a free upgrade with their sincere apologies the next time we book with them. None. The wash basin in our bathroom was obviously partially blocked and took several minutes to drain It wasn t a major problem and we reported it on departure Whilst the restaurant was fine for breakfast it looked rather boring for dinner so we ate out every night . Nothing . Wifi was weak needed a comfy chair in the bedroom needed adjustable lighting so you don t disturb each other room looked out onto walls windows of other rooms dark and no view at all . No complaints. bed could be a little softer possibly with a topper . Was approx 10 minute walk to closest tube station because its equally distanced between Temple and Black Friars stations Could just be me being lazy though . view the views featured in the glossy information where not visible from our rooms One had an ok view of the courtyard area but he other was the view of an unfished building project not much else . N A. Over priced it is a nice hotel but facilities and offering is not validating price charged This time I was lucky and get very good offer on the price via booking com I will be coming back every time when I m able to secure such price Breakfast is disappointing . Absolutely nothing. Booked without breakfast but decided in the evening to opt for breakfast Were told when we booked in we could pre order any time but when we went to the desk in the evening we were told we should have ordered it when we booked in and that it was too late now to get the special offer so we ended up having to pay the full price Conflicting information from the staff . Food drink was delicious but a little pricey. There is absolutely nothing that we didn t like . The breakfast is expensive . Room did get very hot during the night had to get up to put on air con Wifi is not super speed as stated in fact I couldn t log on at all for our two night stay . An extra 30 charge I m still to work out for what The additonal 30 Wasn t on my receipt at checkout Would be very disappointed to learn an additonal charge had been added for the 10 mins or so we went into the club lounge upon checkout Especially when we thought it was very hospitable of them to let us gather our thoughts as we were rushing at checkout . My one experience in the dining room was not great I ordered a cheese omelette server brought ham omelette horrifying this vegetarian . All night menu could have had better quality choices . Would have liked an Easter Duck to go with our christmas duck Parking is quite a distance from the hotel However very good rate Would be nice to have the option of valet parking . Breakfast was great but wasn t buffet style which I prefer but that s the only minimal thing I could think of everything else was amazing and would recommend this highly. Nothing could be improved Our stay was excellent . Breakfast staff were aloof and unhelpful . There is nothing I would criticise the hotel for . The only thing for us was the location as we are not familiar with London We found it quite difficult to find Other than that we couldn t have asked for anything better . Nothing of note . Room backed into another building and thoroughfare Lack of privacy so had to keep the curtain closed. elephant wonderful but the cow is not needed . The bin men came a little later on a Sunday morning but hey we were in central London its noisier in 5 hotels Certainly not the hotels fault . 24 hour bar service would be good but I can t really fault anything we had a brilliant stay . It would be nice if it was a bit cheaper . There is a definite problem with the smoking ban for those who smoke one has to walk all the way through those corridors to smoke outside There has to be a better option available either a special smoking area inside the hotel or the availability of rooms for smokers . Room not set up well for using mirror at desk for make up hair as poorly lit and too far from sockets to use blow dryer provided in room Since staying over for a night out with friends these little things would have been nice . Did not take breakfast but expensive. Nothing . Too hot everywhere Air conditioning system in the bedroom was difficult to manage tried to set it at 19 degrees but it seemed to jump back to 24 . Breakfast too expensive so ate elsewhere . too expensive for me most of the time . There was nothing not to like . Receptionist stand offish and rude on arrival however I would visit again the positives by far outweigh the negatives . Tea and Coffee facilities were good but not excellent These places never leave enough milk in the rooms This is the worst thing I can say about the hotel and it s not even that bad . Would be nice to have a pool and spa facilities and no views. Nothing we loved our stay . Wish we could have stayed longer Shame the room didn t have a view but didn t matter for one night . I would of loved to of stayed another night or two . We had late night drinks and noticed all others had complimentary nibbles We didn t get any and over 10 for 2 beers it would have been appreciated . There was no table and chairs on the balcony and only 1 plastic chair in the corner of balcony In a double room you d expect there to be 2. Not sure bar a little expensive compared to other similar venues . Only a one night stay . The room itself was clean and of a good size but lacked in any form of character It felt like a place for business rather than somewhere you would go for lesiure It was a stereotypical hotel room very basic design art on the walls you d expect to be in every other room no character or unique qualities The view from our room was also dissapointing a concrete wall It made the room very dark However not all rooms can have a view and that is understandable In this instance I was after something more romantic but for those who aren t this hotel is perfect and cannot be faulted for its cleaniliness and quality of staff . The maid coming into my room on both mornings at 0930 when mentioned to desk on checking out it was meet with minimal empathy. Room was directly opposite an office that could see in our room . Breakfast overcooked expensive and tried to add service charge removed when I complained Not easy to get to by tube . Pillows to soft and room service to keen Woke us up by barging into our room twice in the morning . the water boiler for preparing the tea was in a cabinet When we moved on the table to prepare the tea outside the cabinet the fire alarm went on The personnel recommended us to always boil the water in the cabinet . Nothing. We paid extra to use the club lounge but they didn t provide spirits which was disappointing as you have to drink a lot of beer and wine to justify 25 It was the only bar part of the break . The executive lounge was a let down and I would not pay the extra to access this facility again . The only thing was that I had asked for a piece of chocolate cake with 2 candles a 3 and a 0 and was promised that it would be taken care off but when we arrived at the hotel I was told that there is no chocolate cake and that they dont have candles A bit dissapointed there cause I would have taken care of it if not promised otherwise . nothing. They forgot to service room and had to be called late afternoon Even then they failed to clear a drinks tray. The Club lounge was good for breakfast however not up to much for the remainder of the day no spirits Canap s or snacks only beer and mixers and water. I still found the hotel a little on the expensive side Also not a big thing but if you re going to have a Bose sound dock in the room there s no point in it only being compatible with outmoded iPods iPhones . Expensive breakfast price . Bathroom too cold and not heated Towel bar heated but only when room key is inserted Also a little surprised by the Club Room no snacking possibilities No English beer . The price is steep It is quite luxurious but maybe not 200 a night luxurious . Not a single thing . Breakfast was quite expensive and wasn t included in the room price They also added 12 5 service charge which for a self serve buffet seemed excessive although good choice of food and tasty. Nothing everything was just right . Nothing to report. There wasn t any information prior to dining to inform us only the New Year s Eve dinner menu was available However our request was promptly dealt with and we were able to choose from the a la carte menu . Nothing we didn t want to leave . Children in the club lounge however hotel adjusted bill when commented on. Service is really poor in this hotel Very expensive for low value services For same price you can find something better in the same location There is a bar in the main lobby the team is inefficient and not friendly at all . Nothing maybe i would have loved to have a bath tub but the shower is good. I know this is London and an extremely nice hotel but it is very expensive . The bed was uncomfortable the bath was not able to be emptied due to a faulty waste system and perhaps most disappointing was the club lounge which only served drinks with no snacks One of the fridges was broken and the coffee machine was temperamental A poor experience compared to the Hilton or other equivalent lounges I wouldn t have minded that much but I purposely opted for the more expensive room with lounge access . Rude reception staff at check in Rooms were not ready and we had to wait in one room for 45 mins then when we enquirer where our other 2 rooms were going to be ready we were told not yet when we were eventually given our rooms they were not fully serviced and once used the key card would not work but apart from the check in the hotel was great. We were unable to check in when we arrived and had to wait until half 2 by which time we were off to the ballet and did not arrive back at the hotel until 6 o clock However being the weekend before Christmas I can understand the hotel was very busy and the staff were as helpful as they could possibly be . Nothing . There was a big problem the staff apologized and I was to have received a refund of some money but I never did aThe issue was stressful I would not return. The standard room was small perhaps one of the more expensive ones would have been better You literally could just walk around the edge of the bed Breakfast was very expensive We didn t bother just 5 minutes walk along the road was Pret where the price was a quarter as much . Nothing. It s not really a bad experience but I did find a pair of socks from the previous guests in the corner of the bedroom There was also an awareness of noise when the outside door was opened and closed so I would request a different room next time . Nothing would happily stay in any Apex property and now considering a stay in Edinburgh. Dinner in restaurant was okay but little too expensive also breakfast was quite expensive many caf s around can t recommend Garfunkels near St Pauls quite far from underground if carrying a suitcase but bus stop in front. Ok not major moans but Far too hot in main areas halls but room has thermostat to cool it down Restaurant wasn t good just about ok Food a little cold and too pricey for what is was . Breakfast was a little over priced but we did get a 25 discount . Expensive but this caliber of hotel in this location are all very expensive and relatively speaking this venue provides good value . We paid 39 for the day for car parking but when we asked the concierge we were told that the hotel had discount parking 3 mins away Why don t they advertise this A van parked outside outside our bedroom and left the engine running which was bad . We couldn t check in with two attempts even at 2 45pm which meant because of our own other plans we did not get access to room until gone 9pm Although we had a complimentary upgrade we could not make full use of the facilities and enjoy this lovely hotel fully . Parking there isnt any the parking is about half a mile away The hotel could do with valet parking services . The walk from the nearest underground It s not really that far but I m pregnant so I struggled a little bit. I just don t think a room without breakfast is worth 269 I suppose the problem is that if people will pay it you can charge it . Bathroom smelled soooo bad Like a dead rat un the pipes And at 9h in the morning cleaning lady entered the room while I was still asleep what the hell . Breakfast is quite pricey but lovely. Breakfast in the morning is not very well organized Could wait more than 30 min before getting your english breakfast. We found the mattress a bit stiff have doubled the topper that helped Minor points Only one hook in bathroom we needed more Lights in cupboard fine but why no lights in tea coffee cupboard We could hardly see what we were doing with the hot water . The only drawback no parking But there is a public car park 15 minutes walk from the hotel In the preliminary correspondence with the hotel we received very polite and detailed instructions on how to find parking Special thanks to the staff for it . Hotel clearly had issues at breakfast and couldn t cope at busy times with several guests waiting 45 mins for their cooked breakfast However hotel didn t charge and sent a quick email apologising. As in most hotels it is hard to see adequately in the mirrors to put on make up or for my husband to shave A very common fault . Only one european style 220 Volt electricity plug however Adapter would have been available . Expensive glass wine but you pay for the location Not a problem. Slightly further away from tube stations but good bus links and ttaxis. Very few cons Entry from street was how we entered initially Not best with luggage Rear court entry hard to find was better Some cabs knew some did not Also lack of hooks in entry or bath made for sleek look at some loss of function . Breakfast is very expensive 21 12 5 even if compared to hotels like the Househorse Guards where it costs some 18 for a richer variety of products a more comfortable restaurant and a more personnal service It s better to go to Balthazar or even a Starbucks where you feel you re paying for what you get . The bed wasn t the most comfortable and the room was fairly small for the price we paid . Breakfast in bed was expensive and was almost cold by the time we ate They forgot the orange juice . A computer glitch caused double holds to be placed on my credit card for my stay However the staff responded quickly to attempt resolution of the issue . The pillows are super thick so if you prefer thin pack your own . The restaurant and bar are expensive Not much to do in the immediate area at the weekend but the West End and Thames are just a short walk away. The grubsrew that secures the tap faucet to the Tap mixer unit was missing and was only discovered to be missing when the tap was used and water pressure then pushed the faucet off the mixer tap base this was reported to reception on Sat Sun and Monday morning still no fix before check out amusing the first time you flood the bathroom and take a cold shower More amusing when the second time it is not you who gets wet Definitely not amusing when it happens a third time because maintenance cannot fix the faucet only push it back on . Only minor thing was room wasn t ready 2 hours after we could have checked in We then waited another hour with a complimentary drink it didn t detract from our stay but if we had waited 3 hours it would have time from check in to room ready . The only issue we had was finding the hotel via our taxi drivers Do a little research on the location beforehand to help your taxi driver out . Menu breakfast not included and expensive visit to Gafunkals Cafe 2 min walk was a great alternative . Nothing . The only tiny issue I have is that there is no green tea available in the room without having to call room service . No milk for tea making but it didn t really interfere with the great stay we had . Nothing. I wish we could have stayed longer . Nothing. nothing. Ridiculous service charge at bar even though you go to bar and get your own drinks and take them to your own table Reason being that waitress did not understand order for bottle of wine even pointing it out on menu . Nothing . Expensive Restaurant lacked any character. Breakfast was decidedly mediocre given how excellent everything else was Certainly wouldn t pay extra for this next time . The room on the first day was a mile away from the lifts however on the second day another room was found where we did not have to walk so far . Breakfast could have been better organised with a few extra staff although the hotel appeared to be fully booked and therefore was very busy A few items were unavailable on Sunday due to shortages The breakfast itself was great and the staff impeccable . Nothing not to like second time we have stayed here . Nothing. I believe daily rate differentials should be advised to customers not after the fact.

Nothng to fault . the right elevator is in the need of maintenance. Nothing. nothing Everything was great. Nothing bad to report . Nothing. All great. Nothing not liked. Slightly expensive as paid 187 with no breakfast included . Rented junior suite Bedroom area had no windows. The first night we were given an extremely small room with the bathroom door broken Next morning when we made a complaint they gave us a perfect room . They stolen 800 from my money from the safe box at my room I couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back They can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money . The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again . The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality . Our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel It did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft . Noisy air con . Our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room We had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience I asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for 7 days was put off Additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and I was always hot The junior suite was too small for 3 people The sheets were not changed for 7 days Choose a different hotel . Our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking Unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working The worst part is tiny bathroom It combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet . Very small rooms Bed was uncomfortable Shower flooded the bathroom No bath Carpet and mattress were stained Expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard . The photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is This room will only just have enough room for you luggage . It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for . Run down needs new furniture and painting Not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough . More tea bags and milk for making your own drinks would be good . Rooms were not very well maintained Not clean at all To be honest we were expecting better in the money we spent I will never stay in this hotel again . The A C control in the room did not work We notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed We needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature The furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat . Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate . We couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view . Wifi is slow as it seems to be in most London hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available. The room was very small and at the back of the hotel off the main corridor we checked in late in the evening and I felt we got the small room at the back cause we were late arriving . Tiny rooms v small shower cramped space for suitcase. More space Just my wife and I packed in room On website rooms appeared much more spacious Staff was nice but very difficult to communicate with . Tricky to find as there are two similar named hotels in same area . The restaurant is quite cramped and seemed to be a bit chaotic at breakfast I waited a long time for my pot of tea Then when I asked when it was coming I was given someone else s pot of tea whom had also been waiting for a long time . Underfloor heating in bathroom was on even though there was a heat wave . The mattress was a little crunchy . Rooms are a bit small with not much space to store clothes But the beds are big . This is a noisy overpriced hotel When I arrived they put me in a ground floor room next to the road really right next to it When I tried to go to sleep all I could hear were people outside and the television upstairs I requested a move and was given a new room Some where in the room was a boiler unit in the wall that would turn on every now and then and sound like a small jet engine In the morning I could here the person above me taking a shower and flushing the toilet . Although it wasn t an issue for me as it wasn t vital there was no instruction to operate the TV and the provided Handy device . Nothing A nice hotel in a very convenient area with excellent staff . Very tiny space no room to walk at all Shower is super small I am tiny myself but I didn t have room to turn around . The loo hadn t been cleaned and had been well used . The room was a bit small but still very good for London standards I was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure . The design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet Would be better if there is a segregation The tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight . Room was advertised as twin bed but was only 1 bed Not very appropriate as I was travelling with my mother 75yrs and had to share it No reception for my phone in the room. N A. we could not close the door to the main room door without having to lift our bed up and the bathroom was just a wet room that was so small it made the whole bathroom wet stright away. The staff here are indifferent and the hotel didn t respond to communication in the lead up to my stay I arrived 4 hours prior to check in time and had emailed twice in the week leading up to staying to ask for an early check in even offering to pay for it after a 30 hour journey from Australia I didn t receive a response and my room was not ready until 2 hours after their advertised check in time I was offered a toilet off reception to use to change and told they would store my bags The toilet floor was covered in urine It was a disgusting and disappointing start to my trip that coloured my view of the hotel . There was water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom in the morning which I thought was odd There was also no plug near a mirror to do my hair . Seat cover in dining room badly ripped which detracted from the ambience a little . Very restricted in bathroom too small and did not like the overhead shower . First night I was put in a basement room with no signal not ideal when you re trying to work in the evening They moved me for the 2nd night and the TV didn t work for the majority of the evening . Shower screen could have been a little wider so less water splash but we sorted it very quickly as it was . Bathroom needed a bit of renovation. The bed was very uncomfortable and too small The room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room . Nothing Everything exceeded my expectations . I did not stay long enough to spot any flaws I thoroughly enjoyed the experience . I stayed for 5 days in the hotel First of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small Then the A C controller was not working in the room so each time I had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room And the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift They told me they will change the room but they didn t . Room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing. Our room was very small and in a basement That I did not expect The was no space to unpack things from suitcase Not much daylight no view . Room was tight bed was so close to wall you could not walk around it Made getting into bed a challenge for one partner . For the hold on my credit card they took a physical impression on carbon paper Can t prove this is related but that same evening I had a fraudulent charge on my card for 0 99 on iTunes The hotel was great but I don t think I will allow anyone to take an impression of my card again . No fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless . Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent . The hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small But that is the luck of the draw . paying at arrival cause when something goes wrong like there was no hot water next morning you cant just move somewhere else quickly . There was no hot water the day we checked out ended up travelling without a proper bath shave and while checking out not a word of apology either. Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised. Our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved One had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably . I didn t like the restaurant which was effectively the bar There was a single member of staff who had to do everything run the bar take food orders clear tables and take payments The food was just ok It wasn t a great experience . Shabby room facilities Poor wifi Poor TV options terrible interface and charging for movies Poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel Long hallways with sloping floors Not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk May have been fine 10 years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price . The rooms were well appointed however somewhat small for two friends Perhaps with a partner they would have been alright We stayed in a Club room . You can smell food being cooked in the morning although we were at the first floor Rooms are not quiet too noisy You can hear your neighbors They do not provide complimentary water . The room was too hot and noisy We could not get the temperature down The carpets in the corridors were old giving a bad first impression The shower very small not normal for this price The bar was more like a waiting room . Not electricity in room after card was put into place Fortunately arrived late and left early but struggled the next day to get to work with low battery life . they dont have separate bed base for twin room but mattress are separate shower is small and i can hear upper room shower. Nothing. Don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms Booked a Double Delux Room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a Compact Double Room though reception confirmed we had a Delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a Compact Double Room that is what we had Very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for 2 shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase Bathroom was a wet room Did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by . I could not easily control the temperature in the room Instructions on the wall would help . The shower had limescale on the floor the bed was dirty initially and room furniture was a little tattered but was all rectified when I was moved rooms twice. Reading lights over the bed should be individual Impossible for one person to read without lighting up the whole room Safe difficult to set and in strange position Hairdryer difficult to use because of position inside a wardrobe . Avoid basement rooms No windows We had for one night and staff offered us room change to upper floors for remaining three days when we requested . Accommodation did not match website images Not value for money Unwillingness to allow us to relocate. I asked the reception to book a taxi for me to the airport but at the time that the car supposed to arrive there was no booking at all so i need to call the taxi company by myself and fortunately there is a taxi available that day. Bed was a bit small and air conditioning had a noise problem at some point was fixed quickly but recurred a few times. Cleanliness Awful There were two pair of dirty underwear behind a desk chair Obviously housekeeping dies the bare minimum I was revolted Bed No mattress pad Gross Itchy sheets Because of my discovery of the underwear when I moved the chair to the desk I was obviously creepiest out fir the rest if my stay Staff Unfriendly and unhelpful . Havent figured out yet . Nothing. We booked a trip with 2 rooms and in one room children of 16 and 14 however when we arrived they were given a double bed when I asked for a twin room as the boys didnt want to share a bed we had to pay a considerable amount extra for the twin room which we should have been told upon booking . Restaurant could be bigger. This hotel needs maintenance or may be even renovation Bad hygiene I have never seen a four star hotel with a dirty lift elevator before Rubbish litter thrown in the left no body would bother to clean it Dirty bed sheets cannot be justified no matter how nice the staff were . Room wasn t bigger than what i have expected Wasn t that bad tho . Small stuffy room and uncomfortable bed The room kettle was out of order Footpath was being resurfaced outside our window ground level Room rate was quite expensive . Room had been made smaller what it should havebin Not enough room for clothes No bedside cabinets not much room to pass at the bottom of bed Not very good for 4 star. The bathroom I didn t so much mind its smallness since I was travelling alone but what I resented was the fact that as soon as you ran water for a shower the bathroom turned into a swimming pool . The ventilation system worked throughout the night and was very loud even after turning the controller off Didn t get much sleep as a result . On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it . The room was way to HOT l went to reception and told them Thankfully it wasn t a problem they were able to change some settings at reception to cool air in our room and when we return that evening the room was nice and cool . Breakfast should be included with hotel price It s a good spread but too expensive for extra fee . There was insufficient hanging space for clothes There could have been larger cups for tea and coffee making facilities or even a teapot The room was fairly small but perfectly adequate for a couple exploring London . This hotel was not a hotel I choose before then they transferred a new hotel where it s name is park garden kessington They did not say me this situation before it is very interesting experienced for us we are shocked Nobody wants to go a hotel that they did not choose in Booking They had to notify me about the changing hotel but they did not do it . lack of advertising there are two of these hotels on the same street having arrived at the wrong one first and waiting at reception to be told that their sister hotel was another couple of minutes walk up the road ok no big deal it was a nice day . couldn t really work the mobile device and had to go down to find internet code . Like most London hotels the room is tiny smaller than the photos suggest . View was terrible I booked a triple room but with the sofa bed up u couldn t get round the room Bathroom tiny . Room was awful Constant buzzing air con room was dark and cramped Booked a luxury deluxe but the room felt like a standard No iron in the room Overall bad experience . Bed was very hard and bathroom would get pretty flooded from the shower but it was small so that might not be preventable . Ganska slitet n got bristf llig st dning Irriterande att det bara fanns tv l gen p belysningen i rummet och att b da s nglamporna styrdes med samma lysknapp . That i Had to change hotel first Because hot Water did not work at this property So i payed for 4 nigts in a suite But the first Night at the other hotel i just got a normal room . I couldn t point out anything. Not even a conversation with the hotel staff when checking in The room was a deluxe double room didn t seem like it Seemed very small Considering that this was our honeymoon you would like those extras thrown in Like swan towels petals on the bed etc Not even a congratulations either . Very poky room Shower room was soaked after a shower and you had to fight with the shower curtain at the same time as having a shower Our room entertainment on the tv didn t work couldn t buy movies Staff didn t seem bother about our issues. Rummet var mkt mindre n v ntat Mobilt element men endast ett str muttag Frukost var inte v rd pengarna r rigt frukostrum och h gljudd personal och det slutade med att vi t frukost ute varje dag L tt att h ra andra rum via ventilen i badrummet och matlukt fr restaurang . During our stay on both mornings we were woken at half 6 each mornig by a high peck noise coming from the pipes in the bathroom when we complained we were told it never happened by for we were given a 15 refund which was 40pound for the price of the hotel it should of been more by sleep on both nights was ruined . Room given was in basement with view of a wall and nothing else felt a bit cheated by that . the only downside was the size of wardrobe not very deep and no chest of draws only bedside draws we stayed 2 nights so wasn t too much of a problem but if you had more luggage not much storage. The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast . The room 138 is small and I do not like having to shower in the toilet area Would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if I was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility Air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well . The beds weren t very comfortable The room was stuffy but we were able to open the window . This is the forth time I have used this group of hotels and the 2nd time I have turned up and had the excuse of there is a problem with the boilers and you have been affected and we will have to relocate you I told them to stop using the same excuse when they overbook the hotel as it does not work for me They tried to convince me to go to South Kensington Hotel which is told rubbish I managed to get another room in the hotel Just very poor attitude to use on customers . The room was quite small and bathroom a little bit basic Also found that the a c made some strange noises and had to ask for a remote control for the tv as none in our room . My father staying in a single room with a twin bed paid almost as much as we did for 3 people in a large King room with sofa bed . The bathroom was badly designed You couldn t go in after someone had taken a shower as there was no shower basin just a trendy drain away style hole in the middle The tap didn t work properly either. Do not book at this property absolutely no value for money Rooms were extremely small very dirty with lots of dust everywhere Bathroom was disgusting cracked walls mirrors and floors and toilet with no proper flush Room sizes were extremely small for 2 people less than 6sqm which is beyond human We felt like rats living there with no hygiene standard Absolute catastrophe for a 4 star standard equals more like a youth hostel in a remote area . The room was small . You advertised breakfast included in your booking com web posting When I completed the booking it did not indicate breakfast included Misleading I emailed you at booking com and received auto reply with no direct follow up to my inquiry I asked hotel staff at check in and was not offered the breakfast Your booking service is less than satisfactory in this regard The hotel is not 500 metres from Paddington Closer to 1200 metres . They take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further 8 days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted 20 despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which I refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit . I was charged 300 more than I should ve been and was never reimbursed the manager was very rude and not very helpful at all . My room was a compact double and it was really small made worse by a huge TV fixed to the wall which I had to squeeze past to get around the bed . Bedrooms. The room was lovely and modern but some furniture was looking abit tired and I booked a room that said book now pay at property but I was charged on my credit card which wasn t released for 7 days after checking out . The floor in our room was very slippery and we thought we should have had a better room considering they had messed up our booking and we had originally had a room that had no hot water etc . Girls on reception weren t very friendly To request a late check out I had to call one hour before check out time 12 noon which was defeating the purpose of having an extra lye in as our flight wasn t until 9pm Even though the hotel wasn t fully booked was able to check via this website I couldn t book a late check out upon arrival . Incorrect room type allocated rectified for the second night of our stay but no financial compensation Problem with electricity in the room on our second morning took almost an hour to repair A smell of greasy food at the main entrance and reception not very welcoming . I felt like they tried to trick me when I paid with VISA card by offering the choice that I can pay in EUR which as far as I understand incurrs additional costs Why that . The room is so small the compact double room but no space for opening a suitcase everything shall be done on the bed Too expensive even considering the location . very simple standard accommodation Nothing to shout about No bath only a small shower in the small bathroom The toilet roll was positioned almost on the floor really which got wet when you took a shower . 1 small window in room barely any light no view or fresh air Felt like a cellar Very small bathroom Expensive . Doorman and guests standing at the entrance smoking made it hard to get in and out Also once the sofa bed was up fro the three of us it made the room very very small . The carpeting in the corridor out side the room was worn out the hotel needs to pay attention to detail The bathroom was not replenished with Shower Gel and other items had to ask for it everyday . Receptionists that can smile or even respect you as a customer On check in it was great however on departure Not even a smile And why does every hotel in Paddington area require a photo identity Having travelled around the world with the exception of middle east country s only Paddington seem to have a hotel a trust issue all very frustrating and unnecessary . Room was oppresive already not much light coming in and with dark wood alla round in room you din t want to spend more time than necessary in there I got a disabled room but a men of 190 cm in front of a sink at 70 m height isn t comfy Staff wasn t present at all Beside doorman no one greets even if they stand behind reception doing nothing and watching you pass by . Noisy for some reason in the middle of the night you d hear the boiler sound which was extremely annoying since woke me up multiple nights One of the trainee staff came inside the room despite being told not to when they were searching for someone s bags It s nice that they help search Not when you are showering on the toilet . Would have liked fried eggs for breakfast as well if possible . We were given a very small room not in line with we booked but we were relocated to a bigger one Everytime we hada shower during the 4 days stayed the bathroom was a flooded. No fridge in the room Very noisy heating system and very early and noisy housekeeping Very poor and expensive breakfast Cheaper to eat somewhere else . Really small room hit my head on the roof I m not 6 8 I m 5 9 my wife had nowhere to hang her dress Not good for our anniversary bit disappointed Think the room would be better use for the cleaner as storage. The food was not as good as I would have wished We ordered room service the steak was overdone and the condiments bowl was full of HP sauce no vinegar mayonnaise etc . n a. Our first night put in a rabbit hutch of a room unable to close door properly because bed was in the way The bathroom door also touched the bed The bathroom was just a small wet room no extractor fan took shower room full of water mirrors frosted over impossible to clear Hotel obviously taking advantage of customers using this room outrageous to claim it s a double room 219 . Although the wifi is working very well there is little to no signal in the rooms of the basement floor 1 Also the heating airconditioning system is a bit noisy . I felt on reflection that it was pricey for just a room. Very little space in the room Bathroom was tiny Was unable to enter bathroom after having a shower due to wet room style shower which caused the floor to be very wet for a number of hours after Air conditioning unit made screeching noises when turned off or low fan And humming noise was constant when turned on Also if temperature was set at less than 20C the unit was extremely noisy Had to walk sideways to get from one side of room to the opposite side due to the position of the bed being so close to the end wall of the room . We didnt have a clue about london before we went so i think we might chose a more central location next time . Very noisy in early morning Cleaning stuff rude and unpleastant Barged in lift and then would not move to let us pass very rude couldnt speak english. We felt like the room let us down this made us want to eat out and just use the hotel for sleeping . Cleaning could be a lot better. Fire door immediately outisde my rooms banged frequently during the early hours Evening meal was served in the bar the restauarant downstairs was only for breakfast . Nothing I can think of Everything was super . Older style hotel room with dated furnishings Not very spacious for those travelling with larger bags . Hard to find a single plug socket easy in room wood effect on walls made the room feel small and enclosed heating didn t seem to work well was 26 but didn t feel even 22 maybe because room on ground floor and draft coming through the windows Didn t see the point of little entrance before getting in room especially there being no plug socket in there very disappointing. Didn t end up with the original hotel we booked and we were meant to have deluxe rooms Which we didn t have. Temp of room a little cool and also needed thicker duvet for our preference but minor complaint . we enjoyed our stay. There was a leek in the roof above the shower in room 421 . The room was very gloomy despite being club room room service was very bad poor ventilation and location. Beds are old and not comfortable at all Also the blankets need to be thicker or another blanket added especially during winter time . Remember to get a room that s not in the basement level B . I think a bed topper on the mattress would have let me sleep better I like hard beds but this one was a little too hard . Nothing. It was bought as a present for my sister but even though I was promised the night before she could check in she was not allowed Ended up using nearly all her spends to pay for the room Her review follows The room service was wrong on the first night someone walked into our room and the fire alarm went off in the evening I slept eventually with the door barricaded with a small wooded contraption I cried once in the morning and once at night They are unbending in their rules and gave me a bottle of wine to apologise They admitted the information was wrong but the guy who spoke to me was in training I could not go out in the evening as could not afford it I had to stay in the hotel for the Friday and was able to spend what little money I had on the Saturday Oh and at breakfast I hope you don t get stuck in the little cupboard they have The deluxe double room had no charger next to the bed and the wardrobe is really for one person for one night When I had a shower I had to remember to move the toilet roll as it got soaked the night before Our anniversary was ruined apart from what we salvaged and this was all down to the hotel Very upset with their unbending policies They need to think about their customers . The walls are so thin you ll wake up every time someone passes the corridor Your bed will liteally shake when someone walks in 15m perimeter I couldn t get a good sleep on ANY night . Room was baking hot but phoned reception and they turned off the heating . The size of the bathroom was abit cramped . The elevator was too slow We had to order empty cutlery cups and glasses every day The room survive should have this changed for us everyday . I asked them by email for an earlier check in and they never answered back We arrived at the hotel about an hour before the regular check in time and they let as wait till the exact time The room was a little bit cold and the air condition was not working correctly The tables for the breakfast was very small . our room design could be better Needs small lights by the bed instead the only choice is to switch on VERY bright lights which are set in a very high ceiling above the bed Blinding . Was a bit strange going to the basement for a room . I booked a deluxe double and was told that the room had a queen size bed However the bed was pretty small The duvet was quite thin so I had to call down reception at 3am for a blanket Also the room was very small quite claustrophobic The next morning after checking out we went to the bar to have a coffee We are the only ones there the barman took our order then disappeared for 15 minutes and didn t make our coffees so we left Not good service at all . Sofa bed and the fact that you could not shut the door with the sofa bed up you had to lift it up to shut the door. The breakfast room in the basement was a little chaotic with customers and staff everywhere The food was good but not a good dining experience not what I was expecting compared with the rest of the hotel . I booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it The room was tiny Literally the smallest box room I have ever stayed in The bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided The shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor Which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet There were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult I resorted to using the TV to see my reflection as I blow dryed my hair The room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened Altogether an awful experience and I will not be staying there again The pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got Very very disappointing . Hangar space limited . A little farther from Paddington Station than l expected 24hour room service would be nice . The room was a bit small but you d get over it as you d spend little time in the room with all the stiff you be doing around London. the room could have been a lot warmer There was no visible heating in it but there were 2 electric radiators but because there were 3 of us we had nowhere to put them . The room was noisy at night either because if the water pipes or air conditioning People would also stand in the corridor and have loud conversations outside of my room not the fault of hotel just rude people I had the compact double room and it really is compact Wouldn t recommend for 2 people I m not a tall person and my feet were hanging off the bed Shower was very small but convenient if you want to use the sink sit on toilet and shower all at the same time I didn t but it s possible . I was expecting to get a better room as we booked deluxe double but the room was located on the ground floor did not have a bath only shower so I do not think it was a deluxe room as we originally booked . My room was right next to reception and really noisy ALL night with people coming and going and shouting Room was also TINY and we didn t even have the smallest . Room a bit dated and needed some TLC Iron leaked everywhere . After paying to secure the reservation I was asked to pay for the room upon arrival the money has been taken out of my bank account twice was advised that it was a pre booking that the money should be refunded into my account in 3 days Not happy my account has gone overdrawn if the money hasn t been refunded by tomorrow then I will contact customer service and get them involved . Nothing This hotel and staff are superb Definitely stay here again . The only thing we didn t like was the wet room style shower in the bathroom However it was bearable . We were disappointed to find our room was not ready when we arrived at 4pm It was then ready after 15 20 mins so not too bad but as we were booked for dinner and a show in the west end it was stressful for us all at the time . There were a lot of stairs . Room was a little small but that would be expected from being located in a central area . We were switched hotels at the last minute and no one notified us Rooms were too small It s very likely they are the same size at all these same chains We had 3 adults and a baby with a baby bed Even without the baby bed there was hardly any room to walk through the room but we made it work However it was a nice place to stay in a decent location Lancaster Gate Station underground was closed when we were there or that would have been nice also . The room was a little cramped for 2 people considering the price that was payed for it . The room was cold on arrival the heating was turned off and it took a long time to warm up also it only single glazed . The check in girl was not very helpful basically she said I couldn t stay there because I didn t have photo ID I informed her I had stayed there before but she didn t care Ended up letting me stay The room didn t have no towels in it I had to call room service to get them The bathroom smelt very bad like old potatoes I will not be staying again . The room was tiny even by standards for having stayed elsewhere in the U K The room on the 4th floor got too hot and the ac unit did not work neither did the hair dryer so we kept the window open . The room is way too small No matter how well appointed it is nothing the hotel does can make up for the fact that this feels like a rip off every single moment Barely any elbow room . The pipework in this building is very noisy and we could hear it people all night using the taps We also were originally placed in a room in the basement without windows which was not mentioned as a possibility in the room information . The shower was interesting as it was in the corner of bathroom with only the curtain separating it Needless to say the entire floor and a couple of walls and maybe the roll of tp were soaked following use . The bathroom could have a bathtub . We went to the wrong ParkGrand Paddington moments before and they were very rude staff before they told us that we were not staying in this hotel . The room was incredibly hot however as soon as I rang reception they lowered the temperature immediately so we could sleep I just wish I had rung them sooner and given them an opportunity to help out earlier I could fault their service . The room was to small and there was not enough room or hanging space No place to hang your coat or sit . One member of staff was particularly grumpy but all others were perfectly happy . There was constant cold draft coming from the window which made the room cold at night Even though the windows were closed it did not make any difference I hope the hotel can look into this matter . No closet in the room leakage from shower doors . I didn t book another night should have . Not being able to sleep very loud noice in room sounded like a generator Disappointed on the very little sleep I had . Minor issues No lamps next to bed only spotlights that are too bright No plugs next to bed for phone charger No ironing board and iron in room Major issues Heating system didn t work properly Impossible to control and was just too loud to have on while trying to sleep Ended up just turning it off which meant we were freezing all night Loud buzzing noise all night from either heating system or extractor from within wall cavity made it near impossible to go to sleep Rudely woken at 4 am by Idiotoic delivery men dropping off laundry Our room was ground floor next to the rear entrance Talking loudly non stop banging doors with engine on right outside our window for atleast an hour Totally unnacceptable If that wasn t bad enough at 9am we were again rudely woken by some prat outside our windows removing hundreds of bags of rubbish from the basement below our room onto the road ready for collection Absolutely no acknowledgment that paying guests were asleep less than a metre away from him and with the windows single glazing these loud people may aswel have been in our bloody room This room should not be in use with the current routines they have in place The whole experience was just a shambles After telling reception during check out we were brushed off with I will tell the relevant departments no mention of sorry or I ll arrange for a Manager to call you . The shower wasn t designed particularly well as everything around you either got very wet or you got stuck to the shower curtain . The only thing I d say that could have been slightly better was the friendliness of the hotel staff they were OK but maybe need a bit more chat to there customers Also as I am a genius booking com member I had free late check out but I wasn t able to find out whether I could have this or not until the morning we were leaving which left us a bit uncertain with our day plans . Our double bed was two twins pushed together and I kept falling into the gap Bathroom was a wet room door kept catching on the shower rail door was damaged due to the damp nowhere to put toiletries or toothbrushes loo roll almost on the floor so got damp room was dark small had no mirror furniture was a bit worn looking I prepaid for our room 5 months ago on an old bank card when we arrived at the hotel they wanted a copy of the card I paid on I no longer had this The staff member insisted that I paid again on a bank card that I had on me and that she would refund the original amount paid onto the old card I was very annoyed about this as there was no mention of having to bring the card I paid on After paying again on my only debit card it left me 150 short for my husband s birthday weekend refund will take 4 working days I had prepaid so far in advance so that I could forget about it and splash out a bit whilst in london My husband and I very rarely get a weekend without our children or the money to enjoy ourselves so this dampened the Weekend for us . No satelite tv No parking at the hotel closest parking was 5 10 minute walk away in a pay display carpark. I made the booking on behalf of my 18 year old son I am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that I was to be refunded This practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room Having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son I had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications In my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to Heathrow airport the following morning Please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed The reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow It should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible Helen Jackson. Rooms are a bit small without enough room to hang clothes in wardrobe Also not enough wall sockets we had to move furniture and look behind wall fascias . Tiny bathroom with no counter space . Nobody had told us that our original hotel was undergoing maintenance but it was all sorted very quickly. Size of room small wardrobe space tiny for 2 people. The size of the bathroom is very tiny especially in the standard room . The staffs attitude The cleanliness found nail clippings on the floor by the bed and also a dirty extension lead that was left in there by a guest before Health and safety plug socket loose on the wall . Didn t look like the photos online there were biscuit wrappers and rubbish on the floor by the bed . The room wasn t very warm even with the heater on the small vent in the roof wasn t enough for the room . Standard Room was no bigger than a closet stuffy and bathroom was a wet room very tiny Room suitable for one person for one night Staff very friendly and quick to respond when TV didn t work expensive for what we got. Tried to overcharge me for breakfast I d already paid for Luckily I still had my confirmation email to prove it Hairdryer difficult to get to as positioned in cupboard over bedside table . However when we went up to our room the 3rd bed had not been made up so we had to wait for all the bed linen towels etc to be brought up Restaurant was absolutely boiling Is there anyway that it could be better ventilated . Our room was on the basement floor and there was a noise coming through the air vent the entire night which made it very difficult to sleep . Had no dislikes found the hotel to be just what we needed . The receptionists were not polite their English wasn t even that good to begin with The room was very tiny you could barely pass by the bed if I was a bit fatter I wouldn t be able to pass The bed sheets were not changed since day one there were stains The toilet was so tiny and the shower was horrible there is no way to shower without drowning the entire toilet The location wasn t that great and it took us a while to get in and out of the area . If anything the curtain rail was slightly off centre my partner only noticed as she spent a long time lying on her back. The bed on our room wasn t very comfy the sofa was a lot softer and we would have shared that instead of the bed if it was bigger . I informed the reception when I checked out that one of the bathroom tiles were loose and raised I also explained that I had stubbed my toe on the tile I stressed that I was not complaining merely pointing out a fault that I thought needed attending to I was disappointed that the receptionist showed little to no interest. I booked 2 nights in this hotel I have paid the total fee when I arrived at the hotel but they also take 160 poubds pending transaction from my bank account I will leave uk in several days and cancel my UK bank account but they did not return my money I sent them emails but they didn t have reply me I ll not recommend this hotel to my friends Disappointed . Room was tiny even though it was meant to be double deluxe room but staff changed us into another room quickly The heating system is really loud . n a. the restaurant was not open in the evening meals had to be taken in the bar area Also no childrens menu or offer of smaller portions . The room was compact and efficient but lacked warmth very corporate and clinical feel. The ventilation pipe was passing through my room and at certain moments at night it was producing much noise not letting me sleep well The room was really small and the shower tight . The room was small especially the double bed which was incredibly small The breakfast wasn t included in the room rate and expensive The wardrobes are not wide enough to hang more than one jacket They resemble the fridge door in their size . The air conditioner made a bird noise constantly We had someone look at it it stopped for about 30 min and started again We previously stayed at this hotel for the past 5 years this year the room was tatty we asked for an early check in by 1 2 hour the room was not ready for 1 hour after we arrived I do not believe we will stay there again I don t believe it was good quality for the price . You could hear the traffic although the hotel is not located near a main road you can hear vehicles passing by . Staff could pay better attention to detail Eg I booked a wake up call and never received it When I let them know that they basically didn t care . Rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet . My only small issue was I thought room service could go on a little later as it s a chain hotel but not a huge deal. Very small bathroom in effect a wet room Fine for me but could be a bit small for a less able or larger person . The rooms were extremely small wardrobe was not usable no where to hang up anything wet also can hear the shower running in other people s rooms below and above you. You can easily hear people talking or walking at the corridor . The air conditioning unit was making a lot of strange sounds beyond those of a typical unit . Room was a bit cold and only a plug in radiator to warm it up Ventilation system made an annoying humming noise every so often . The evening dining facility was not so good with a bar menu meal had to be sent back although again the lady on duty was very apologetic ourselves and various guests could be heard making detrimental comments on items purchased . I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel . I booked for 6 nights instead of 5 I contacted them within 5 minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though I contacted them straight way The built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed . A shower curtain There was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor. The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it . Relatively compact rooms and small bathrooms Limited closet storage space for clothes. There was nothing on this occasion that I didn t like If I was going to be picky I would of liked it to be closer to the main shops . I confused this with the Park Grand Paddington which is a few doors down the street Their premium rooms are nevertheless rather small and kidney shaped OK for a 1 night stop over but hard to settle in to for longer . Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great . See above. 4 start Hotel should do more than a poor service Every thing is chargeable even water The size of the room is so small and the design Is very strange can not understand it The matters and pillow is very poor quality and had strong headaches every day morning . Views aren t fantastic and the plumbing pipes are a little noisy from other rooms . The one time I did stay here and wasn t moved the room was large but with artificial lighting all around the perimeter On the ground floor right behind reception so could get noisy and also no power sockets to recharge any items Badly designed room Someone from the hotel needs to spend a night in the room to see the issues . Compact double is a very small room tight wardrobe space safe not big enough for laptop no mini bar and or complimentary drinking water Certain furniture fixtures looked quite used and could do with replacement refurbishment All in all a pleasant hotel though . Although there is in room AC it seemed to make no actual difference to the temperature of the room. The television and beside control didn t seem to work although that could have been me . Hot water working but worked out better for us in long run. Shower room leaked water into the bedroom as the floor drainage wasn t appropriate Previous occupants had got the carpet wet which wouldn t be difficult You need to shower in minutes to prevent water seeping into the bedroom . Room was either way too hot or way too cold and window didn t open properly so had to have air con on to cool down but then became too cold no happy medium. No new bottles of water to drink every day Also only get biscuits with coffee in room on first day The Air conditioner units just outside of the window makes a lot of noise during the night . Fire door near our room banged during the night slightly annoying and could wake you up . The amount of sugar and milk that is left for you to make coffee tea Unfortunately left a necklace in the room before we left for another location Was never located . We were on ground floor with great bay windows but it must of been bin collection day so a bit of an early wake up call . The bedroom appeared small with all the wood around it The breakfast room was tiny for a full crowd and as was the bar where people could not enjoy a drink without listening to the table next door . Buffet breakfast was a bit expensive Rooms were a bit tiny but manageable. The evening dinning area needs to be improved . No privacy The staff can come in any time although you lock the room from inside I found that quite shocking Never seen anything like this in my life The staff will knock but will NOT wait long enough They just barge in Also the wardrobes are a mockery of the word The layout of things in the room is quite awkward i e location of the kettle power charging points the so called wardrobes everything is at user un friendly location in the room . Originally placed in the basement which is totally depressing without a window however I did ask to be moved and they happily obliged . We booked a deluxe room however the room was very small and it was difficult to change clothes for our night out therefore didn t seem like a deluxe room . the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard Also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed . What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy . First night we had to stay in an extremely small room They did move us to a much larger room for the rest of our stay . Not much The bar closed earlier than I would have liked Surrounding area didnt have a lot going on but close enough to paddington station. Our room was not serviced The bed was two single beds pushed together . The air conditioning was not working and I had to change the room in next day And I could not sleep well that night . The tea and coffee making facility was poorly positioned on bed side table in my opinion this could potentially be very dangerous due to limited space Need to find an alternative area . Suit space is very small bathroom without a tub or shower breakfas area is small closed and crowded I styed in suit with king bed size but I foud it tow mattresses not one with king size it s horrable while you are sleeping. The heating didn t work Certainly not worth paying this much Staff were not very helpful or apologetic but rather claimed their screen in the reception said it was warm Soy milk at breakfast was either old or diluted with water. Fire alarms kept on going off randomly bit disturbing Lighting in the room wasn t that great But overall a good stay with minor drops . The staff was very in co operative and the rooms were awful to say the least I was finally shifted to a bigger room but when I requested for check out till 3 PM on Friday the lady told me that till 2 it was okay and she will try for 3 Then she says that she will do it only till 1 and not till 3 No reason was given for this at all . Size of the bedrooms were small Had to phone each time for a ironing board Breakfast was mediocre No comfort in the bar Each time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower you could hear the water flushing down the pipes in our bathroom . deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower . It wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com The room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room After we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working It took a long time to deal with this in the evening The showers were weak in both rooms One day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed Overall too many problems . The automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers Staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar Was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense But no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how I could go about getting it . Deluxe double was tiny My partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed We were next to an elevator so loud noises all night Shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure TV was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly If u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable But saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us . Very poor value for money Very poor room despite it being what was classed as a deluxe Bed against window so had to scramble down the bed to get out Very disappointed and first time I ve had a poor hotel from Booking com. The breakfast Bleak and poor for that price Even the pictures of it were faded and didn t give you a good impression of what was offered Should have been included in the price of the room if that is all they can serve . The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights . Room was tiny and dark I got moved around to a different property one block away because Park Grand had hot water issues Then when I checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location Too much money for such a small room . The main mattress for the bed is too soft Feel painful for the back after sleep overnight The mattress for the sofa bed is too weak I still can feel the springs They can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses . Due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in It was the walkpath to go to all the rooms . Room was too small for 2 people A double bed with 2 mattresses does not pass as a twin Overpaid for what I got . The double room was so small there was no room to store bags Two people were unable to dress at the same time The walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use Friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided The gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room Very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating . The shower water is hard I couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while Also on arrival at the airport I called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer I also found the direction address given to me unhelpful In fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one I booked for was under renovation I turned up at the place I booked and found no renovation going on and busy and I got the room I booked for Perhaps it was a mixup . The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London . Everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in Central London however a room which has just 18 inches of space around the bed Washroom was also a disaster 140 plus per night is deserves more . One of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to Underground station. the bathroom wasn t really hotel standard No counters to do makeup or blow dry hair The room was too close to the stuff pantry noisy all through the night Hotel stuff didn t bother to replenish towels or make beds properly Carpet in the room was dirty from the day we checked in. We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back . The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks . Room a bit small . The room had a terrible view of a scruffy building and the windows were disgusting Lack of parking and staff said it would be OK to park where we did Ended up with a parking fine Ruined a birthday suprise I had planned for months for my partner Wouldn t stay again . Fairly newly renovated looks great but bathroom plumbing isn t The space is small and okay if you re travelling solo . We were not give the size of room we paid for first night we had to complained Web mentions complimentary fresh fruit and water in rooms this did not happen Wardrobe space nonexistence even for one person let alone a couple The rooms were too compact Wash area needs care and attending to seals around basins and tiles. Delayed checking despite not arriving till 7pm 3 bed was child size and like a camp bed towels for 3 provided but not cups glasses toiletries they were all for 2 Breakfast time was crowded in a small area meaning staff could not keep up with demand despite their best efforts No where near a 4 star more like 2 We don t understand how the AA rated as a 4 star Definitely not worth the discounted cost. Small room at basement floor. Room very small but spotlessly clean . no refrigerator in the room you can ask the staff to put your food in the kitchen refrigerator Very small room I think the bedsheets were not changed everyday. Some of the furniture was very dated and needs replacing I didn t like our club room being situated in the basement . The bathroom was quite small And no bath . Would like to have had a bit longer for check out but this didn t really cause us too much of a problem . The chairs in the breakfast room had no padding Towels need to be bigger as I m a average sized person and they didn t go around me . The room we have been given was not as I saw in the picture at and the bed was too small and the room was too small No places to hang my clothes. The cleaning staff usually forget to replace toiletries that have been used up . we booked twin room but when we arrived they gave us double rooom Anyway the other day they offered me the Twin room . Breakfast wasn t great our hotel had maintenance probs taken to Hyde Park grand hotel instead room was okay some parts a bit tired looking had discount online nights stay would have been a little disappointed if paid full price. When we checked in at the given time of 2pm our room was unavailable and would be told we would have to wait in another smaller room for 1 hour 3 hours later our room was still unavailable Due to having plans my husband 20 year old daughter and I had to get ready and prepared for our night out in a very small room We then had to leave our belongings with the staff who said they would put our things in our room when it was available Fair enough our belongings were in our booked room when we returned to the hotel 4 hours later however we found this very unsettling There was no sofa double bed pull out in the room like there was shown in photos there was a tiny bed set up with a very thin mattress which my daughter said was uncomfortable . A single room allocated on first night for two persons was not acceptable The price of breakfast was too high as we did not have the cooked meal . Not the hotel I booked room too small to swing a cat in inflexible cancellation policies. Bar area poor staff didn t know what they where doing a lot of waiting around at reception poor facilities in reception area . Basement room cramped pics shown and actual room are different With a queen sized bed in the room you can forget being able to walk about no place to put bags . No plug in basin which wasn t attended to Basement room very claustrophobic Carpet was dirty . The beds and pillows were very hard and uncomfortable Room had seen better days Interior needs refreshing There was what seemed like animal hair on the bed linen so unsure if the room we were given actually allowed pets Found toe nail clipping on the floor. Small bed rooms some in basement with no views like a dungeon could only hang 4 items of clothing up in cupboard Very crushed dining room no room between tables . More than 450 yards from tube station and my partner struggled to walk Bed up against window Couldn t get cold water from tap . Wet room bathroom meant whole floor would be wet after a shower personally prefer a separate shower otherwise great . One of the two matress was very soft Maybe the variety of breakfast is a bit short for a stay longer than a week . Eventually when I returned there was only one room left Probably the worst in the hotel Some staff were poorly trained gave misinformation . The small bed. There was no iron or ironing board available within the room which is only a minor complaint . The air conditioning in the room did not work well . One Bed was broken room 801 triple room Breakfast was average everyday is the same breakfast The toilet location is very bad no space for the other leg. Wish we could have stayed a bit longer . The mattress could have been better didn t have a good night sleep . The Club Room was located in the basement with virtually no natural light The cafe restaurant was right next door to the room with grease odours permeating throughout the room The tiny room was decorated in dark stained chipboard and it looked as if it hadn t been decorated in years The room they moved us to the next day was better only as it was lighter Don t believe the pictures on the website The staff were clearly not trained in basic customer service as they had little knowledge of solving even the basic of issues and found it difficult to hide their annoyance when I had the ordacity to complain . Not unusual in London some rooms are small we upgraded to a bigger room for not much more money all the rooms look very newly refurbished and very well fitted out . The room was great for a solo traveller however space and wardrobe would have been a challenge for 2 of us especially if you needed to hang formal clothes The rainhead shower was awesome and the hand held option good If I had a full head of hair maybe a challenge if not wishing to wash it The UNenclosed shower great if you do not need to use the toilet or brush your teeth after in socks as the floor gets wet Again if 2 sharing would need back up of floor mats slippers etc . Sofa bed uncomfortable Very unhelpful concierge refused to allow customers to contact alternative staff who could make decisions. After hauling 4 suitcases across London we were informed there was a boiler problem and we had to be moved After my initial reservations the sister hotel just around the corner exceeded our expectations The staff are truly amazing and went out of their way to ensure a great stay. Hotel was just a bit quiet for what we had wanted Ideally it would have had more of an atmosphere around the bar or something in the evenings . Bathroom sink backed up when very little water was run Black mold on shower floor floor draining shower Rooms a little cramped for space Travelling with 5 people could have used more help with luggage on arrival . The meat in the breakfast was pork so we couldn t eat it during our whole stay since we are muslims . The facilities are not that much there is no refrigerator or iron I reserve a room with 2 single beds but there are no rooms with single beds in the hotel . On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith. Small room bathroom spaces. The underfloor heating in the bathroom was a bit hot but better than none There was only 1 bedside table . I think some bedrooms are quiet small but if only stay for one or two days is OK . Felt the staff could be friendlier accent was hard to understand hotel is a little tatty and our deluxe double was tiny no wardrobe space except to hang 3 shirts nothing for dresses etc also was my birthday and my boyfriend proposed staff had been informed and nothing was supplied as a congratulations . The fact that I wanted to extend the stay which they were unable to do where as when I rang them before leaving I was told I could So then I had no choice but to pay extra I felt the staff was useless . The staff at the bar was not really qualified WE ordered a bottle of Prosecco but instead of pouring the first glass as one would expect the just left informing us 10 minutes later that WE would need to pay as they are closing We got a room in the basement which is considering the price I would have liked to know prior to my stay . Not sure it was the problem of the hotel or booking com The triple room I booked was canceled due to inefficient credit card I provided However the card is totally fine when I checked in to the hotel This cost a great trouble during our first night in the hotel . As mentioned staff have no authority to help the guest always they have to back the main office. they gave us a room in the basement then when we wanted to change we had to wait more than one hour we were there at 8 pm don t know they did this because was a late arrival But it was a very bad beginning and not easy to get over because the second room provided had a window over a climatisation area and was very noisy 24 hour . The first girl on reception was a bit over the top the rest of the staff were lovely I was over charged for two extra nights I just emailed hoping to get a refund. First room 802 was under the dining room and was extremely noisy scrapping of chairs on the floors woke Up by the noise Did complain and the staff who were very very helpful moved us to a room that was smaller but quieter so we had a very nice sleep. The gym is in the basement floor at the end of a long corridor Not so encouraging to use because of its location . Bedroom was like a walk in wardrobe Staff had very limited English Wasn t asked if I slept well on either nights Room had a loud running water noise all night Premier inn hotels are x20s better. the room was at the back of the hotel and the window was looking at another guests window poor light ng was coming through it was like a dungeon . Nothing . The room was very small for the price and the wet room toilet was very very small so if you had a shower it would get the whole floor wet The room was hot and we could only open the windows about 2 inches . The staff in room service over the phone were rude the bathroom was a wet room which flooded everytime you had a shower as the plug was blocked the room was very small just big enough for a double bed . Bathroom was ridiculously small and tight Shower sprayed all over the small floor making it slippery as did the tiny sink The rooms are faded and dated and didn t strike me as very clean Would not book here again . Maybe some better refreshments in the room instead of wine but other than that couldn t fault it . Didn t appreciate the small room originally allocated given I was staying 7 nights Had issues with the bathroom of the new room allocated as well but friendly staff sorted it out . I hated the fact that there was no Lip on the shower the entire bathroom was wet after one of us had a shower never saw this in a hotel before The room was very small for a so called deluxe double The hair conditioner was never replaced . Check in seemed unnecessarily fussy in terms of things that needed a signature I ve checked in to other hotels through bookings com before and hardly needed to sign anything on arrival Also although I didn t go in to the club room it didn t look anything special through the windows and certainly nothing worth upgrading your room to have access to I didn t see the point of it . All good nothing to dislike . We were given a twin beds pushed together that kept separating whenever someone went near the middle and also were given a room in the basement had a frosted window so there was some natural light but not able to open it or have a view Asked for both things to be fixed and the staff were unable to do anything except put a sheet over the two beds Staff were generally unhelpful and snooty no information given at check in. As a family of three we needed the fold out bed which was really uncomfortable The head lower than feet and a metal bar could felt across back . there was no plug beside the bed for charging my phone . I requested a tomato soup in the evening from the bar The service was very bad the place was empty but they took ages to bring the soup It was awaful soup the worse I ever tried just a red color with heavy layer of fat with no taste disgusting For dinner eat outside the hotel there are acceptable resturants around the area . Couldn t see a hairdryer but didn t ask so it may have been available . A C in lobby was not operational during check in but not the fault of staff Felt badly for them as we were soon ensconced in our a c room . A lot of chipped and broken furniture Not much room in restaurant for a busy hotel Television was confusing to operate Loud air conditioning . At the location we booked they said there were issues with the room so we had to go to a different location something this hotel seems to do a lot looking at the other reviews The other location was just around the corn we but the room we were given was definitely not the size we booked . No curtains in room and staff very unhelpful when told about them told we should have complained the night before but we did not notice as it was late when we got to the room Staff refused to deal with the complaint . Nothing It was all very good. N a. Bedrooms are way too small also double beds of three quarter beds Booking show you photographs for their larger rooms for their standard double rooms. Called up hotel to ask if I could leave a bag two days prior to check in and was informed this was OK On coming to the hotel I was informed I could not do so I would not have minded if I was given the correct information when I first called Secondly the receptionist on duty did not handle the situation well she was unsympathetic and said I may have misunderstood what was told to me by phone implying either I do not understand simple English or perhaps am too stupid to understand The halogen lights in the room are too bright and glaring . None. Noisy old floor. The room was just a bit compact Fine for a solo traveler but I wouldn t have wanted to be sharing Although having said that the bed was very comfy . Wardrobe space could have been bigger. Room was very small and the wardrobe is only about 4 inches deep within a wall panel the bedside table below it made it very difficult to reach If only there for a night this would be acceptable but there was 2 of us for 4 nights This was described as a deluxe room and was told be reception staff that you need to book a club room to get anything bigger . Room and shower room very small Shower room was pointless as water just went everywhere and had to use all the towels to dry so that I could continue using facilities Lady serving drinks in bar was not qualified to serve as had no idea how to mix certain drinks . Didn t like the first bedroom we were put in was in the basement dark and claustrophobic Given a better room on 2nd floor Breakfast room was bit small and very warm . firm pillows. left my earrings behind called half an hour after check out the room hadn t been cleaned it was 5 minutes later but they couldn t find the earrings I saw them before leaving and believe they were taken. Very small room the shower room could have been a lot cleaner as it was a wet room but very small the water covered the floor so using the toilet after someone had showered was very very slippery . The breakfast was crowded the restaurant small and food wasn t piping hot We were advised of WiFi but this wan t available in our room as was in the basement meaning we had no phone signal either not all bad . Room was a little small and 2 nights was enough . Rooms on the 4th floor are extremely small You have to wait in line to have breakfast the space where they serve breakfast is claustrophobic . The layout of the room was a bit awkward Otherwise our stay was lovely and we were very pleased with the accommodation . Only stay here if a loud fan in the room does not bother you Even when I switched it off it was still really noisy The result minimal sleep Not ideal when all you want is a peaceful nights sleep ahead of a busy day . What s not to like . Hot breakfast didn t look very good very pale scrambled eggs not quite up to the standard of the rest of the hotel and breakfast Very limited wardrobe space . The continental breakfast was a bit too expensive . I asked the desk person to order taxi for certain time but because tube down no taxis The person should have let me know right away unable to book taxi as had plenty of time instead I had to run with all my luggage and missed my bus Cost me additional money to get next bus . Breakfast too expensive . More coffee sachets and some juice soft drinks in the empty mini bar would have been good . Got there at 12 15 to leave bags was told Room would be ready for 1 30 when we came back to hotel at 14 00 was not ready and had to wait another 15 minutes. The room we were in only had a view of rooms across the other side of the building . bigger dining area for breakfast breakfast queus where possible if you are not an early bird this may be partially solved by recommending breakfast in bed for guests . Beds are terrible Lumps and tilting Building is run down. I was moved to this hotel on checking into my original hotel Receptionist informed me that because of the change I was going to get breakfast inc when I went to the room I had been allocated it was very small in comparison to my original room I had booked I was disappointed and told staff who informed me that it was the only room available but I could check with her again in the morning Breakfast was ok but a very small area to move around in Think I was probably overcharged as well . My bag was stolen from the hotel lobby and that speaks a lot on poor management and lack of security It took the hotel half an hour to view the cctv footage and i think the response from the management was atrocious I lost a lot of money and as a traveler it was a nightmare to be in an alien city without any help from the management The management did not even apologies for what has happened I would advise Booking com to withdraw the hotel from their system and also advise travellers to not to stay at this hotel Imagine a bag being stolen from the lobby of the hotel Very poor attitude and shockingly unbelievable behaviour . The staff is unorganised I ve booked the hotel through booking com and I ve paid for the room in advanced The staff kept on letting me put in my card again and again thinking that I haven t pay yet Which made me late for the meeting Also I ve arrived an hour later than the time they set for the check in and my room is still not ready . 1 I booked a deluxe room a couple with 6 months infant and noted my late check in by calling the hotel Upon arrival no one helped us with the babystroller and our 3 bags receptionist was looking and waiting 2 we have been given a room that is just a door and you directly must hop on the bed I doubt if it is suitable for human being though we have an infant and I ve been told ooh ok that was our last room sleep and squeeze your baby and tomorrow we give you another one 3 in that room no refrigerator to keep my baby s milk and food I guess that is illegal and no one cares 4 there is no shampoos no soap nothing at all a blocked sink 5 next day another room and offered me a breakfast to please us after I spent the night sleeping under the bed to give a space to my child 6 I just had a look at the breakfast sorry this is not something to offer I moved away immediatly 7 The hotel is outdated and rubbish 8 They took extra booking price compred to the one I see on booking with a difference of 100 USD. The room was slightly cramped There was an unnecessary mix up with the registration which resulted in our getting a smaller room but had free breakfast thrown in instead . The hotel good location and clean but some staff very badly with me really I surprised from them They should be more professional and helper all coustmers they need more study and qualify in field hotel business Bcz the price increasing more that 150 that not accepted in any hotels and countries special in UK we like UK Thanks. Bathroom was very tiny . The breakfast area seemed to be too small to accommodate all the guests Every time we came there was a waiting time to be seated However well managed by the staff . Maybe a little nicer view For 2 nights though no grumbles . View from room was of a wall looking at another part of the building . We ended up in a very small room up many flights of stairs even by London standards and no one ever came to fix the TV Because we were relocated to the attic we did get free breakfasts . The room was very compact and the bathroom was a space saving wet room a bit of a squash for 2 people but manageable for a couple of nights . Bathroom was small and with few shelves or places where to put personal stuff such as combs cream shaver etc Room lights were poor no night lights for raeding Hair dryer inside a wardrobe not accessible from the bathroom only to be used from the bed Furniture in wood needed maintenance . Room was dark and cramped not great value for money . The room is too small especially the toilet It does not have a proper shower area and everything is wet after one is taking a shower . The shower flooded the floor every time The basement room had no opening windows to a grotty storage yard The bar shut too early . Slight back room noise in our room from outside the staff did try to deal with it but couldn t do anything about it but did offer alternatives. We were transferred to grand park paddington court and was not able to see the rooms I booked The court s room toilet and bath is small not suited for 2 persons as expected. room was on the ground floor named club room indeed good in size but with strange dispositioning of wardrobe hairdryer . Nothing really other than room maybe slightly small for 3 people but manageable . Despite 5 rooms being paid for IN FULL in advance with a company credit card the hotel were still worried about something what I don t know so they insisted the person named on the credit card to be present even though they had already been paid Ridiculous One of our travellers paid for breakfast then when she sat down for breakfast they told her she had not paid when she had We will NOT be using this hotel again . The room was overall filthy i doubt if the bed sheets were changed before my arrival and the toilet cleaned found human hair in both The corridor smelled burned cooking oil from the kitchen It was one of the most disgusting hotels I ve stayed at It certainly didn t worth the amount of money i paid for it . The breakfast buffet was ample but not high quality products I would suggest going elsewhere for a good English breakfast . We were there for 5 days it would be nice to have something different for breakfast not the exact same thing everyday There was only one elevator so sometimes it was a bit of a wait . I was moved on arrival despite only booking that day Apparently there were maintenance issues but it didn t stop the group in front of me checking in The hotel I moved to was further away from where I needed to be small room was not the cleanest a bit tired and not somewhere I d have chosen to stay Overpriced and dissatisfied . Everything was fantastic only thing that could have been better is that my bed was too short . Nothing . We booked a deluxe double room for 3 nights spent two nights in a compact double room No deluxe double rooms were available for us We also didnt get fresh towels on day two Definitely not 4 stars . There were no real restaurant facilities only the breakfast room and then the bar . Really helpful staff but staff were not allowed to kept the bar open after our visit to The Shard so eight of us had to have a drink in one bedroom. Basement room so no natural light Couldn g get room service on one of the nights Listed as 4 Star Hotel I wouldn t rate it that high compared to others I have stayed in . Room not available on time Staff helped someone behind us before helping us Hotel insisted on photocopying my identification which I refused breakfast disappointing. The room was very difficult to access within the building which consists of townhouses that have been remodeled as a hotel We had to go up an elevator up some stairs down some others and it was confusing long and very difficult to handle with our heavy bags Thankfully the staff is attentive and responsive and there to help with luggage Another issue was that while the bed and room was clean the window was very dirty The window was also small due to the location of the room within the building . The people behind the desk really ought to be able to read the details of a booking properly to avoid guests being misdirected to a considerably smaller room This took too much time to correct . Bed was hard as a rock Worst nights sleep ever Bedroom was squashed was tiny no need for the word deluxe far from it No breakfast included and already paid 141 pound to stay Never staying again . Rooms are slightly small and there is just a little noise from the corridor because the floor is wood . There is no shower cabinet but the shower is only separated via curtain The complete bathroom was wet after taking 10 minutes shower At check in they offered to give us a local smart phone and we signed some papers It was supposed to be at room but we never received the phone even after calling the reception from the room twice When we asked at reception they apologized for it and told us there was a problem but I found it quite weird . poor staff that couldn t help me having to pay for the room before I checked out having a damp basement room that shouldn t have been rented out water stains on the ceiling. The booking was done for Deluxe Double room and from 23rd I called them ahead to tell them I will be checking only on 24th Morning I land up to find the reservation was on hold even though they had charged me on the previous day itself Once it got unblocked they provided me a Compact Room where if you walk you will hit a wall When I enquired about the same the staff was unapologetic and started explaining how the Victorian buildings tend to become smaller on higher floors When I was not buying the story they provided me the actual Deluxe Double Room that is more comfy The staffs arrogance and lack of coordination is seriously needs to be looked at During all these commotion that manager didn t even bother to come out from his Palace . Nothing springs to mind I didn t take advantage of the breakfast deal Portobello Market was waiting so couldn t rate that . The most expensive and also the smallest room with minimal facilities that we stayed in for over a month in Europe but hey that s London Consistent with most other hotels in this area for the price . Didn t dislike anything. The rooms could be refreshed there s a different design on the photos than in reality Also the airconditioner could be refreshed it was a bit smelly but fortunatelly we didn t needed so we could turn it off . Room is quite small . Pretty tight space Tiny bathroom . room beside outside air con which came on and off during the night which was noisy breakfast very expensive at 12 when you could go across the road for 3 50. The bedroom furniture was a bit tired and the wash hand basin was cracked . Was a bit a a walk from Paddington not ideal when dragon a case. We recived a groud floor room where the windows where located above the staff s smokeing area The hotel blocked the amount of money coresponding to one night payment from my creditcard an after 1 weak I still didn t reciveit back . Noisy neighbour. a socket for plugging your phone next to the bed . Room was a bit tired the air unit or heater or whatever buzzed all night which was very annoying and storage closet space was limited London itself has become a tarpit foul air congestion and everything and I mean everything is so grossly overpriced The city probably tainted my view on the hotel somewhat but I will never visit London again other than perhaps in transit to somewhere more pleasant . The facilities were very basic Breakfast was expensive and extra The location is a little out the way and the food offer is very basic The room was very basic bed was comfortable Check out was a nightmare . Nothing negative to stay the place is wonderful. got moved to park grand paddington court and was allocated to the basement should have a choice of not preferring basement before. I was expecting a delivery at the reception and despite having a confirmation of the delivery the night staff refused to give it to me arguing that it has never been delivered It is only when I ve threatened them to call the police that my package suddenly reappeared without the slightest apology Outrageous I strongly advise you to chose another hotel if you have any concern for your belongings . The room for the price When I went through booking com I looked at the pictures under the room I was booking The room I got and the pics of the room was completely different ends of quality I m lucky I complained and they gave me an upgrade 150 pounds for this I wouldn t have paid 75 for it . Nothing to dislike. my only issue was at check in where the reception staff sought to take an imprint of my credit card using an old swipe machine Although this was procedure I objected to any swipe of my card I am happy to leave holding deposit for additional costs but refused The staff to be fair didn t argue I have stayed at sister hotel without problem . Breakfast is not very good especially the scrambled eggs were tasteless Bedsheets very hard and itching Skin was very rough afterwards for days Please change your detergent. I like to sleep with the windows open which meant I was disturbed by street noise in the early hours my husband is a heavier sleeper so heard nothing . Air conditioning awkward to control Would rather have been able to open a window especially while asleep . there was a terrible noise all throughout the night sounded like there were pipes rattling really loud every time I opened the bathroom door i could hear next door as thought they were in the room with us The hotel charged me a 91 retainer prior to arrival which i still havent been refunded . Room was changed at arrival Not sure how was the original one supposed to look like The one we got was a bit dated otherwise ok . They dont clean the room very well i give them 7 from 10. Menu and lack of room service at certain times Some rooms are really noisy you can hear full conversations of the people next door There are other rooms where a huge fan goes off outside The building needs better Windows to keep the noise out . Breakfast could be better More yogurt choices larger croissants more fresh fruit Service was great there and in the bar Cappuccino was bitter Machine may need cleaning . Rooms are very small hardly any space to move Every day 2 small bottles of water be provided There should be atleast one more electric socket . The room is very very small The room was not cleaned daily So far from the stations tube and bus It s for sure not a 4 stars hotel as it s part of a residence building . Went for a club room Badly designed with bed base taking up way too much space making it hazardous in the night added furniture wasn t helpful and the only plug points were in the drop down desk tv could only be viewed from bed so two chairs were no use and neither was the formal desk bathroom was a wet room cubicle that soaked everything when in use as the shower curtain kept sliding away. It was a very noisy hotel We were woken at 6 30 by the people upstairs walking backwards and forwards across the room and could hear toilets flushing etc We were in the basement No other complaints. I booked a deluxe twin room As per the photos it looked good enough When we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m I thought I made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back The room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage Staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse Good staff but greedy greedy management and owners Really bad experience . Silly question nothing . They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware . Service in the bar was slow at lunchtime when we ordered a salad Another time we sat waiting for someone to come and take a snack order . My room was in the basement If I needed to stay more than 1 night that would make me feel uncomfortable I should have been told during booking that the room was in the basement . They assign you a different room then you reserved and lie in your face that it s the same one Insects on on bedclothes They give you one towel for two guests The air conditioning was going crazy loud every 15 minutes during the night The room is so small it s hard to walk . The shower was cold and unfortunately so was the room The little heater provided didn t work at all . 15 min walk from Pasdington station My room was on 1 floor was a bit dark and very much noise from the outside The shower is just a hole in the floor so the floor of the bathroom is always wet. We were made to move hotels because of hot water issues The mattress was yellow with stains If i had noticed this before the morning we certainly would not have stayed in that room I was informed the next day that they had thrown the mattress out it certainly couldn t have been cleaned The headboard was stained The staff were thoroughly unhelpful they couldn t even get me some new batteries for the remote control A second bed had been crowbarred into our room and made it impossible to open the fridge . Boiler broken in first hotel had to be moved to a sister hotel then they got my room wrong putting me in a single with a broken telly. Street side a little noisy in evening but quiet after midnight Wardrobe door with mirror on inside needs a hook to hold it open when using the hairdryer . Booked via booking com and paid extra 10 to have the refundable option and to pay on check out However the hotel didn t inform me that before my stay they were going to take half the money out the week before my stay resulting in me nearly cancelling my card Also I had to pay on check on no issues to either but should have been informed . Rooms are small for a traveller of 6 2 Bathrooms wet rooms are awkward Windows need to be double glazed as constantly woken up during the night with deliveries etc outside Aircon heating doesn t really work that well. small room small double bed not what we expected from a deluxe room Breakfast was not included in the price we paid on booking could have got a better price from the hotel including breakfast if booked direct . My security key to enter the door was disabled each time I returned which was frustrating as I had to walk back and forth to get the key activated . No wifi signal First time room was tiny Spoke to reception moved to bigger room Tap in the bathroom doesn t work properly. Room should have a fridge for fresh milk and soft drink storage Soft drinks and better biscuits should be provided in the room. There was no bar to speak of there was a fairly spartan room serving drinks but it wasn t conducive to having a nice drink Our room was a bit cold and the heating didn t appear to work plus it hadn t been cleaned properly the bathroom bin was full of someone else s stuff . The bed was too hard The bathroom was tiny and the shower was not powerful at all The only mirror in the room was on located on the inside of the cupboard which didn t open fully so the mirror was not accessible The fridge didn t work properly all my drinks were warm the next morning . N A. The air condition was noisy when on or off so interfered with my sleep There was also a little bit of a leak coming from the shower head The fire alarm had gone off as well Could have done with 2 room keys As my daughter had gone off to do her own thing and so did I She got to the room before me so had to wait for me to let her in as I had the room key . There was a strange smell in the hotel and our room was next to a machine that make a lot of noise . The smoke alarm went off several times after 1am just because someone from another room had a shower and left the door open Too noisy . Plumbing quite noisy Room not large enough to have a chair to sit in Breakfast was additional and a little expensive . Staff not overly very helpful or assisting on checkin about the hotel or facilities . The room rate is too high compared to the services provided The room service could have been better I stained my sheets with coffee and makeup on my first night and when my room was cleaned the next morning the cleaners failed to change my sheets . You could hear most things in the adjacent bedrooms and because there were no net curtains or light blinds and my window was facing the internal lightwell if I opened my curtains I could see straight into the bedroom opposite . No window in the room . I didn t like the very small window in the attic room made me feel a bit claustrophobic Would have been nice to have a small bedside light for reading . room a bit on the small side and pillows a bit hard I run a guest house in cornwall you could cut your bread bill in half we were given 4 large slices of toast with our breakfast far too much if people want more they can ask for it also there is nothing worse than butter from the fridge that is rock hard . Top floor was really warm had windows open the entire stay even though it was 10 degrees outside . even though we were told we had been upgraded the room was quite small . No control for heating small wardrobe space and nowhere to hang coats The room was very big though so not much of a problem . The bathroom was very small and had no actual shower cubicle or tray just a shower curtain and a drain It worked well enough but the addition of a shower tray would have made it much more pleasant to use . The staff on arrival weren t clear in fact one told me my booking wasn t with them and I was at the wrong hotel Also at the time of booking i d been informed the room was paid when in fact it had only been reserved the staff were quite rude handling this situation When I got to my room I called for room service as I was shattered I was told by a member of staff that I couldn t order anything as the kitchen was closed she was rude in the manner in which she said this and this ultimately left me feeling frustrated I went out to grab something and used a plate within the room there was a can opener on top of the plate which was encased in food or remains of something this made me feel sick Someone had obviously not checked the cleanliness of this area in some time Great location staff could do with customer service training I would never stay there again . Standards rooms are small but price is low for central London Club rooms are decent size . The room was a little cramped but somewhat expected for London . bathroom a little small. Maybe the staff could have introduced themselves by name on check in the create a more personalised check in. Nothing to complain . The room was a little bit warm There was a fan in the room but it didn t make much of a difference . The room was too small we paid for a delux double but it was tiny the aircon system is also too noisy . Their idea of separate beds was two mattresses 3 cm apart from each other with no possibility to move them The feedback form in the room was for some other hotel chain . The maid service was a little hit and miss glasses not cleaned replaced sugar not replaced there was no mobile signal in our room We paid extra for a club room but didn t really see any benefit the room itself was at the back of the hotel with no view apart from a wall and the only upgrades I noticed were 3 pieces of fruit and some rather scratchy robes . Rooms was dated not particularly clean and with a very noisy air conditioning unit in the room when opening the windows because we were near the restaurant we had more noise from those units Poor considering this was a deluxe room needed a complete refurbishment. Rooms were much smaller than I thought Thought it was a 4star hotel and did not seem like it Good thing i got a good price from booking com . Couldnt fault it . The power in the room didn t work unless you gave the slot on the wall a bang The shower screen was half broken so a lot of water went all over the floor. Air con didn t want to work and room was freezing We had a little heaters but it took hours by the time room was nice and warm . We had a deluxe double room that on initial entry was dirty and in a poor state desk was broken and the TV didn t work properly Not what I expected for a 4 star . Room very small but only stayed one night not a big problem. As already stated there was nothing that we did not like . Checking the fridge for food and drink left behind would have been good A little more milk in the room would have been nice We weren t really there longer enough to request more . However I did not like how I went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and I went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things. The location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre. Slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room Room was stated as delux but was quite small. Check in wasn t available when we arrived at 10am However it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back . I ll start off with the location was good for what we needed But It was freezing cold in the room all night I had to call to ask for extra blankets at 4am felt like I was camping outside Had to call twice and wait 25minutes to get an extra blanket The room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together There was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating The throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice Noise coming from upstairs and next door We only needed it for the night so I guess it did what I needed to do but I probably wouldn t stay there again . No phone signal in my room A bit small room even it s compact double room. 1 In this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in Club Rooms 2 No slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion 3 Lat time I had booked a Club Room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence I chose the Deluxe Double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand However strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes I just don t get it how does it all balance out . The room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast I was one person and was charged for two people. Furniture in club room very tired worn Shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small Tiles of wet room floor cracked too Booked a double room enquired to see if I could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with 2 single mattresses so declined that When checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain Central reservations not easy to deal with on this . This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy 14 99 Room small they call it boutique but really it is just small The room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room No bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a 4 star hotel can afford to provide this for guests . Air conditioning left room cool even when set to 25 degrees Thin walls could hear man next door snooring. we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on The matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable The second night in we were up watching TV and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work So overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great . Be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large Park Grand sign outside The staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel . There was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small They start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint The toiletdoor is right by the bed Rood staff in the reception both checking in and out . I didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature I didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms. Air condition was noisy Pillows were lumpy I changed the room twice but as You were full I had to have the first room anyway The second room was cold and the shower room floor icy . Stayed in room 309 Club Room damp carpet by shower room noisy plumbing and a strange smell . The cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table Not a big problem just poor design . TV could have been a little bigger. Breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially. room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to 32C room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall 2m away internet was slow not enough for Skype call . I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle . I can t say anything bad . Rooms are very small Not a lot of space even in the deluxe Double mirror is far from Plug so Could not Straighten my hair Shower door did not close properly Too expensive. The room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night. To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful . Everything was suburb I would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time I go it is always great service. The gym was good but I would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights. Bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation. Poor Wi Fi connection We missed a cosy lounge There was no where to hang our winter coats in the room Bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush For a Dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry . the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement . Smallest room I ve seen in a long time I booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan Far from impressed . Our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing The window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms We had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue . So called deluxe double room is claustrophobic It is overpriced but what isn t in London In addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not . I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area. Rooms are much smaller than they look in website Booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc Two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted . A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected. Unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat . There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens. Room too small with tiniest bathroom Very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card For security and other reasons I was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels . Bit strange being asked for photo ID to check in I hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck I had my driving licence with me . Room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty I know this is not the standard of this hotel but I had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying I m sure it won t happen again . No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later . Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel. The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service . This particular hotel has a chain of 3 buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised Also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey. There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again. second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy . Disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting One front desk person sent me to post box at Paddington while the next day I was directed to a post box just down the street A seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land . We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us . The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses . I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak . Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london. This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day . Poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed Cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good . When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by . We were told at 9pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but I wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet . Room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option. N A. It would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc . The size of the room was very small No cupboard to put away clothing etc There wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries .\n"
