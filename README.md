### Project Description
Hack-a-thorn is a web application which accepts trip reviews as input and determines whether the review is positive or negative, with its level of confidence through the use of machine learning.

### Use of AI
The AI was created using the TensorFlow software library in Python. The AI uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and performs a process known as sentimental analysis to detect whether the emotion of the review is positive or negative. The AI is also trained to recognise common and key details of reviews, which helps to determine the score of the review. The AI also utilises a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to improve accuracy of model.
